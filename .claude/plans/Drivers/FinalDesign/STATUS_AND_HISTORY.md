# STATUS_AND_HISTORY.md — the one mutable dashboard, supersession ledger, and crosswalk

> **Status: PROVISIONAL LIVE (Phase 3, 2026-07-15).** This file owns STATUS and HISTORY only — live rule
> wording stays in `FINAL_DESIGN.md`; procedures stay in `BUILD_AND_OPERATIONS.md`; channel duties stay in
> `ChannelContract.md`. Any status shown in another live file is a generated summary of THIS file. A status
> change edits this dashboard — and only if rule meaning changed through owner approval, the one owning rule
> section plus a new supersession row here.
>
> **Reading order (front door = `FINAL_DESIGN.md`):** FINAL_DESIGN → ChannelContract (adapters only) →
> BUILD_AND_OPERATIONS (builders/operators) → this file (what is open, replaced, or archived). Temporary fifth
> live file: `15_CandidateFactPacket.md` (owner-frozen v1.0 + the two 2026-07-15 owner amendments Q4/Q1-ext,
> current sha `aa7239ed…`).

## 1. One-page dashboard (2026-07-15)

| Layer | Design | Code | Tests | Production run |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rule meaning (FINAL_DESIGN §1-§9) | FINAL (locked set + 5 owner rulings 2026-07-15) | — | — | — |
| Track A catalog engine | FINAL | PARTIAL (WP-FC-EDITS `5db902f`) | 260 pass + 1 skip | NEVER RUN (no graph catalog; fitness gate never run) |
| Fiscal.ai channel adapter (S1) | FINAL | BUILT | smoke 16 packets / 175 items, 0 tokens | not live |
| Track B fact stack | FINAL (all decisions made; affected contracts NOT implementation-ready — BUILD §11 gaps) | UNBUILT (S3 awaits owner GO) | — | — |
| Track C guidance retirement | FINAL v2.0 (no replay) | not started | — | — |
| Concept linker (text facts) | FINAL | PARTIAL (vetoes C/D + PIT query spec-only) | 31-co + 274-co evidence | not rolled out |
| Admission kernel | accepted parts FINAL; bundle CANDIDATE | — | — | — |
| XBRL-native materializer | CANDIDATE (dormant + `09` rider dormant) | — | EXP-1 signed | — |
| Experiment program | EXP-0/1/2 SIGNED PASS | — | — | EXP-3..6 / WP-FC-RUN PENDING |
| Running layer (schedules/ledger/QA) | NOT designed-complete | — | — | — |
| Consolidation itself | Phase 3 files written | — | Phase 4 §14 checks PENDING | archive (Phase 5) pending |

## 2. Lists by status

- THIS file owns the status lists (one-copy law); `FINAL_DESIGN.md` §10 is the GENERATED mirror. The master lists:
- **FINAL / BUILD-PENDING:** Track A remainder (fold/tree mirrors, finalizer, real folds, WP-FC-RUN, OD-6 fitness gate — never run) · UNIT-14 production wiring · PER-20 resolver build + 21 tests · slice table materialization + PIT menu code · concept-linker vetoes C/D + PIT query build · the whole Track B writer/validator/CLI/park-ledger stack · read layer · verdict/DCM writer · channel adapters + certification · Track C execution · incremental refresh.
- **DESIGN-INCOMPLETE:** the production running layer (BUILD §7's runbook list). The OD-5 change scanner is a recommendation only.
- **CONDITIONAL:** OD-19 (inert until K-pairs.v2 zero wrong-same) · XC-16 timing · model-role membership (experiment-gated) · XBRL-native materializer + `09` rider (dormant until ratification) · multi-run concept stability/caching (only if monitoring justifies).
- **OPEN (owner):** G1 live reuse display · catalog 796-vs-786 + lifecycle/IPO · full model/cost policy beyond signed EXP-2 · FS-23 · 8-K taxonomy · DCM threshold/pure-macro/two-catalyst · Track B dual-producer thresholds · non-USD expansion · metric `value_text`/action `conditions` revisit triggers · Driver Genesis charter questions · Track C history-gap acceptance · third-party `company_confirmed=false` class enablement (part-2/news-channel).
- **CANDIDATE:** Admission Kernel v3.4 bundle (accepted parts are law) · XBRL-native materializer · Bayes proposal · Driver Genesis restructure (rationale). Owner-question decision detail rides in `CONSOLIDATION.md` §10.2 until Phase 5, then moves here.
- **RETIRED (never a production path):** old Guidance replay plan (`13_Track_RetiredDesign.md` — GI stale-trap
  rows in its GI-07) · fixed-vocabulary Driver v1 · eager-reuse v2 · `slice=total` · alias layers · `long_range`
  scope value · `gp_UNDEF` quiet fallback · `evhash16` on DriverUpdate · FS-22 cross-company recurrence ·
  RavenPack import · catalog-first live reuse · SDK/OAuth metered concept invocation · OD-16 materialize-all
  catalog sync (owner ruling 2026-07-15, Q3).

## 3. The 42 supersession rows (terse; dead rule kept once for audit; current wording ONLY at the anchor)

| # | Subject | Dead rule | Current anchor (FINAL_DESIGN unless noted) |

**Additions that are not reversals (each anchored in FINAL_DESIGN):** born-complete + latent-base exception
(§4.2) · OD-1 suffix admission (§4.1) · OD-2 metric-proof + first-fact pin scoped to bare names (§4.1/§4.2) ·
OD-3 blind local role test (§3 NAME-11) · OD-4 = FS-22 retirement, no slice-value recurrence rule (§5.2, row 37) ·
OD-5 scanner recommendation (BUILD §7) · OD-6 fitness gate (BUILD §4) · OD-7 broader live admission = tracked
recommendation only · OD-8 (§5.1) · OD-9 (§5.3) · OD-10 (§6.1/§9) · OD-11 (§6.1) · OD-12 (§6.1) · OD-13
(§4.3/§7.1) · OD-14 (§9) · OD-15 = near-synonym live races accepted as normal over-splits, no new locking (§4.2) ·
OD-16 resolved 2026-07-15 → lazy born-complete (§4.2) · OD-17 (§3) · OD-18 (§5.4; CLAIM separate, ships off) ·
OD-19 (§5.4) · OD-20 (§5.4) · OD-21 (§5.1/§6.2/§7) · K2 = fold repair stays per-pair, batched fold repair
deferred (BUILD §4) · frozen packet v1.0 + Channel Contract v1.0 (boundary files) · Track C full no-replay
reversal (BUILD §6).

## 4. Owner rulings record (2026-07-15, all five §10.2 questions)

Q1 `company_confirmed`: CORE derives from who-said-it evidence; unclear = SKIP (ruling's own content); `false`
stays reserved for explicitly-ALLOWED future third-party classes (enabling any class = part-2/news-channel
decision) → FINAL_DESIGN §7.1. · Q2 non-slice/elimination: NO change — frozen packet PARK+log stands; FS-20
auto-demotion is the drain → §3 OD-17. · Q3 catalog sync: resolution (b) — offline catalog + lazy born-complete
nodes; OD-16 narrowed → §4.2. · Q4 XBRL packet shape: amendment APPLIED 2026-07-15 to ChannelContract + frozen
packet (`dimensions=[]` verified-empty; both axis+member; never fragments). · Q5 first-fact guard scoped to
bare names; suffix-proven lanes may be born `unknown` → §4.2. Full decision text + verification trail:
`CONSOLIDATION.md` §10.2/§16 (moves to the archive with it at Phase 5).

## 5. Signed experiment decisions + remaining gates (authority = signed decision.json artifacts)

EXP-1 PASS 07-09 (O13 dimension binding owner-ratified) · EXP-0 PASS 07-10 (grader = 2× `claude-sonnet-5`
@effort=high; the (model,effort) pair binds) · WP-FC-EDITS `5db902f` 07-10 · WP-FA + O2 signed 07-10 · K-reader
v3 LOCKED 07-10 · EXP-2 PASS 07-11 (sonnet-5@high/40k/1-run) · PENDING: EXP-3..6, remaining keys, WP-FC-RUN,
F-C freeze. Standing gates: ra_0007 kernel-§6.1 review BEFORE K-pairs.v2; Plan sha `51966848…7472` byte-pinned;
WorkOrder current sha `4911a22f…` (status board stale at `1586761a…` — fix before next run). Artifacts:
`.claude/plans/Drivers/experiments/`.

## 6. Known documentation/logic issues (open; no new authority)

- The 24 stale-text items (per-file) and the interim hazard rule: `CONSOLIDATION.md` §10.1 + Phase-2 note.
  Biggest traps: `03`/`11`/`12` old collision text (OD-8 is current) · `04` one-hint-pair (per-slot is current) ·
  `09 §8`/`07 §D` expectation-baseline wording · stale experiment headers (signed artifacts win) ·
  `15` "already built" = "fully specified" (stale-item 11).
- Missing build recipes (packet lifecycle · born-complete transaction · ID namespaces · machine contracts):
  BUILD §11.
- Truly open owner choices: FINAL_DESIGN §10 OPEN list.

## 7. Source crosswalk (33 files → destinations; every row re-verified at Phase 4/5)

| Source | Status | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| 00_Coverage / 01_Overview | stale summaries | FINAL_DESIGN §1-§2; archive |

| 13_TrackC (active) · 13_Track_RetiredDesign | retirement plan · retired history | BUILD §6 · archive (one pointer to its still-useful non-replay analysis: GI-31 `<=` rationale, 894-source reachability audit, 4 stated-mid outliers) |
| 14_BuildReadiness | stale checklist | BUILD + this file's dashboard; archive |
| 15_CandidateFactPacket | FROZEN v1.0 + the two 2026-07-15 owner amendments (Q4, Q1-ext) | temporary fifth live file (current sha `aa7239ed…`) |
| 66_IssuesToBeHandled | owner blocks + stale tail | rules → FINAL_DESIGN; status here; archive |

| BayesProposal | unvetted proposal | BUILD §8.3 pointer; archive under proposals |
| ChannelContract | ACTIVE live file | kept (amended 2026-07-15, sha `4fdeb821…`) — the SOLE public channel authority under the one-copy law; its banner's "source of truth = the frozen S2 packet spec" line records content PROVENANCE, not a second live authority (an owner banner one-liner can retire that phrasing at the next amendment batch) |
| DriverGenesisRestructure | unapproved rationale | open charter questions in FINAL_DESIGN §10; archive |
| DriverPlan.html | stale study export | none (regenerate later from live docs); archive |
| FableAdmissionKernelDesign | candidate + accepted inserts | FINAL_DESIGN §4/§5 (accepted) + BUILD §8.1; archive after exact candidate map preserved |
| FableContextPack · WorkflowContextPack | stale navigation/code maps | archive (Workflow pack: after live-code re-audit + link repair) |
| FableExperimentPlan · WorkOrder | pinned plan · runbook | BUILD §9; keep Plan byte-identical until program migrates; archive after |
| FablePrompt · FablePromptv2 | executed briefs | provenance entries only; archive |
| XBRLIntegrationDesign | pending candidate | BUILD §8.2; archive once exact candidate map preserved |
| CONSOLIDATION.md | audit + migration map | moves into the same dated archive after the four live files pass review (never a fifth rule source) |

### 7.1 Rule-ID crosswalk (every stable ID range → its one live anchor; §14.1 artifact)

| Rule IDs | Live anchor | Exceptions / notes |
|---|---|---|
| NAME-01..19 | FINAL_DESIGN §3 | all 19 inline |
| FS-01..27 | FINAL_DESIGN §5.1-§5.4 | FS-03's old collision text is dead → OD-8 (§5.1) · FS-22 RETIRED (row 37) · FS-23 OPEN · FS-26 → §5.4 |
| UNIT-01..14 | FINAL_DESIGN §6.1 | UNIT-04 replaced by per-slot hints (row 26) · UNIT-14 = build wiring → BUILD §5 |
| PER-01..20 | FINAL_DESIGN §6.2 | PER-20 build → BUILD §5 |
| MF-01..12 | FINAL_DESIGN §4.1 | MF-11 (`company_confirmed`) → §7.1 |
| DU-01..24 | FINAL_DESIGN §4.1/§4.3/§7 | DU-13..18 explicitly replaced by `09`'s contract → §7.1 · DU-19..24 (verdict/DCM) → §7.3 |
| XC-01..18 | FINAL_DESIGN §8 | XC-16 CONDITIONAL |
| PIPE-01..37 (+27a/27c/27d/31b) | BUILD §4 | PIPE-24/25/26/35 finalization/consumption inline · PIPE-32 A/B gate |
| FACT-01..36 (+14b/15b/17b/18a/26b/26e/26f) | BUILD §5 (mirroring law in FINAL_DESIGN §5/§7) | FACT-16 validator list inline BUILD §5 · FACT-17b = the internal packet → BUILD §2 |
| T1.1..T12.9 (census `11`) | the same law as FINAL_DESIGN §4-§9 + BUILD §5 | the census duplicates `09`/`12` normatively; its numbering retires at archive |
| GI-01..04 + active `13` §§ | BUILD §6 | GI-05..35 belong to the RETIRED replay file — history only (§2 RETIRED list) |
| Track A D1..D8 | BUILD §4 | disciplines inline |
| `66` D-1..D-13 | resolved-in-place doc-debt history | archive only; no live rule content |
| OD-1..21 | FINAL_DESIGN §3-§9 + §3/§4 rows above | per-ID anchors in the additions list (§3) |
| K2 | BUILD §4 | per-pair fold repair; batching deferred |
| 42 supersession rows | §3 above | — |
| Contract clauses · packet blocks · candidate bundles · open items | ChannelContract · the frozen packet · BUILD §8 · FINAL_DESIGN §10 mirror of §2 | — |

**External inbound citations (verified 2026-07-15):** 12 files cite exact FinalDesign filenames — the
experiments board/handover/exhibits/keys/harness plus the engine prompts `workflows/menu_build.js`,
`reconcile.js`, `gate.js` (their inlined rulebooks cite `02_DriverCatalog.md` as verbatim provenance — keep
resolvable or re-point in the same change). Stem scans reach 21; bare-word 22 incl. one `INDEX.md` name-collision
false positive. Re-run both scans at migration; update or validate every hit BEFORE moving sources.

## 8. Archive manifest + evidence pointers

- **Freeze manifest:** `archive/2026-07-15_pre-consolidation/MANIFEST.json` — all 33 sources sha-256-pinned
  (11,320 lines / 1,362,208 bytes verified), git provenance, commits `49f1cd8`/`87bc150`. Owner-amended
  live-continuing files verify against post-amendment hashes: ChannelContract (see git for current after the
  2026-07-15 provenance one-liner) · packet `aa7239ed…`
  (recorded in `CONSOLIDATION.md` §16).
- **Evidence/rejected-alternative pointers:** v1/v2 death evidence, unit proofs (117/117 · 29/29+7 · 3×33/33),
  concept-link proofs (31-co zero-wrong · 274-co 100%/~70%/98% + caveat) → BUILD §12. Bayes proposal → BUILD
  §8.3. Executed prompt briefs (FablePrompt/v2) → archive provenance. Experiment artifacts + signed decisions →
  `.claude/plans/Drivers/experiments/`. Relocation/harvest engine state (separate track) →
  `scripts/driver_seed/relocate_probe/STATE.md`.
