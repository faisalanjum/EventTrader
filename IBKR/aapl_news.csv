2025-01-08 11:35:11,AAPL,"Dell Simplifies PC Lineup With Apple-Like Branding: XPS, Inspiron Brands Are Gone For Good",BZ$19b6a9d9,BZ,"On Monday, Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL ) announced a major rebranding of its personal computers, aiming to boost sales by adopting a simplified naming strategy similar to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). What Happened: The company has decided to retire long-standing product names like “XPS” and “Inspiron” in favor of a streamlined approach centered around the Dell name. The rebranding is part of Dell’s strategy to make its products more appealing and less confusing for consumers. The new lineup will feature three tiers: Dell , Dell Pro , and Dell Pro Max , echoing Apple’s naming conventions. See Also: Jensen Huang Unveils $3000 ‘Personal AI Supercomputer' The Size Of A Small Book: ‘It Runs The Entire Nvidia AI Stack' The rebranding is also part of a broader effort to encourage PC upgrades, with AI-optimized systems and the end of support for Microsoft Corp.’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows 10 as potential catalysts. Notably, Dell’s gaming brand, Alienware , will not be affected by the rebranding. The new Dell-branded devices will incorporate neural processing units to improve AI capabilities. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: In November 2024, Dell announced earnings of $2.15 per share for the third quarter, surpassing the analyst consensus estimate of $2.05. However, the company's quarterly revenue totaled $24.37 billion, falling short of the expected $24.65 billion, though it represented a growth from the $22.25 billion recorded during the same quarter last year. In the third quarter of 2024, Dell’s share of global PC shipments dropped to 15.7%, down from 16.7% in the previous quarter. The company remains the third-largest PC vendor worldwide, trailing behind Lenovo and HP, according to Statista. Price Action: Dell's stock fell by 2.72% on Tuesday, ending the day at $121.27. However, the stock bounced back in Wednesday's pre-market session, increasing by 1.3% to $122.85, according to Benzinga Pro data .

2025-01-07 21:47:40,AAPL,!3 Digital Infrastructure ETFs In Focus As Trump Reveals Billion-Dollar Data Center Construction Plan,BZ$19b52918,BZ,"President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the Emirati real estate development firm DAMAC Properties will invest $20 billion to construct data centers in the U.S. to meet the growing needs of hyperscale customers. The race for dominance in artificial intelligence hit an inflection point as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) revealed its $80 billion investment plan to build AI-driven data centers in fiscal 2025, with special regional focus on the U.S. These developments serve as a green light for investors looking to invest in this theme. Risk-averse investors who are interested in cashing in on this opportunity, but are reluctant to choose individual stocks can choose from a plethora of ETFs tied to data center and digital infrastructure stocks. Here we name 3 such ETFs, which carry stocks of digital infrastructure providers like Microsoft and are poised to mirror the gains of the digital infrastructure industry. See Also: Microsoft Pauses Construction On $3.3 Billion Data Center Expected To Be Used By ChatGPT-Parent OpenAI For Massive Super Computer Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSE: VGT ), with a low expense ratio of only 0.10% and $98 billion under management, holds the maximum position in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) with a 16.19% current weightage. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Microsoft are right behind, enjoying weightage of 15.42% and 13.05% of the fund’s total allocation, respectively. iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE: IYW ) has $20.5 billion funds under management and charges an expense ratio of 0.39%. It derives its allocation strategies from the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index. Nvidia (15.59%), Apple (15.57) and Microsoft (14.16%) take up the three biggest pieces of the pie. Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF (NASDAQ: VPN ) focuses exclusively on companies developing and operating data centers. Microsoft and Apple might not be included in the fund currently, but compelling stocks like Equinix (NASDAQ: EQUIX ), Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) enjoy a place in the fund’s portfolio. Expense ratio that the fund management charges is 0.50%. Some Notes On Major Fund Holdings Data centers run by Apple boast unique design features to support energy conservation and have been running on 100% renewable energy since 2014. Nvidia, on the other hand, is expected to ramp up production of liquid-cooled GB200 server racks in the current quarter. Data center REIT Equinix recently acquired BT's data center business in Ireland. Advanced Micro’s aMI300 product line, featuring high-performance GPU accelerators, is expected to rake in more than $5 billion in revenue for 2024, according to Dataconomy. Parting Thoughts Digital infrastructure is the backbone of modern technology. From AI and cloud computing to blockchain and 5G, the global economy relies on robust data centers to keep pace with innovation. A Research And Markets study shows that the Data Center services market, which grew from $56.65 billion in 2023 to $62.23 billion in 2024, is likely to witness a CAGR of 9.99%, hitting $110.34 billion by 2030. Whether it's leveraging Microsoft-heavy funds like VGT or targeting niche players through VPN, investors have a range of tools to capitalize on this transformative megatrend.

2025-01-07 16:36:19,AAPL,"!Apple Analyst Flags iPhone AI Struggles, Google Deal Risks",BZ$19b47bcc,BZ,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock is trading lower Tuesday after MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett downgraded Apple from Neutral to Sell and lowered the price target from $202 to $188 , citing iPhone 16 models with artificial intelligence features failing to gain traction and geopolitical tensions with China. Additionally, Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google deal to pay Apple over $20 billion annually to make its search engine the default on iPhones is threatened by an antitrust lawsuit against Google . UBS’s David Vogt recently slashed the iPhone sales forecast for December, citing dwindling market share in China . Also Read: Sam Altman’s OpenAI Plans Major Revamp Of Corporate Structure Apple’s smartphone sales in China dipped to 15.6% in the third quarter, while Huawei posted a 42% jump . Both companies offered discounts to reach a broader customer base. Meanwhile, Apple remains invested in scaling its News app and improving advertising effectiveness, seeking growth from the publishing industry. The iPhone maker is targeting new countries with the platform, which reaches about 125 million people every month in the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Australia, according to the Financial Times, which cited familiar sources. The company also considered expanding its curated news coverage to the UK and adding its puzzles section exclusive to the U.S. and Canada. The app is part of Apple’s product bundling and services business, including Apple TV+ and Apple Pay. Apple launched the News app almost a decade ago, and it has gained considerable influence over the reading material of tens of millions in the most prominent Western countries. David Higgerson of Reach UK regional newspaper described the News app as the front door to everyone’s iPhone, the FT reports. Apple News has emerged as the top news app in most of the countries in which it has a presence. In the UK, Reach’s publication, the Mirror, has an average monthly audience of about 4.5 million readers from Apple News. The figure gets crucial as media groups have been hit by plunging digital revenues and readership following Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ: META ) news coverage policies and changes to Google’s algorithms. In 2024, Google retained cookies in Chrome, allowing advertisers to continue using cookies for targeted ads. Reportedly, ~40.9% of websites worldwide use cookies to collect user data. Sean Cornwell of Immediate Media told the FT that he won “significant business through Apple News.” Apple News+ has grown from 300 publishers at its launch five years ago to about 450 publishers globally. Apple News’s success has invoked debate in the media industry, divided between those eying a large global audience and others seeing it snatching readers and revenues. Publishers fear Apple cannibalizing potential subscribers. Price Action: AAPL stock is down 0.45% at $243.92 at last check Tuesday.

2025-01-07 15:00:32,AAPL,"Evaluating Apple Against Peers In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$19b41146,BZ,"In today's rapidly changing and highly competitive business world, it is vital for investors and industry enthusiasts to carefully assess companies. In this article, we will perform a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) against its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing important financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 40.30 65.03 9.65 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.84 1.21 1.01 5.72% $1.44 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.73 26.89 3.86 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 72.14 1.95 1.53 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 18.14 3.90 1.47 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 165.51 14.93 7.47 4.44% $0.11 $0.58 8.94% Eastman Kodak Co 9.31 0.53 0.57 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% AstroNova Inc 23.53 0.98 0.59 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 46.03 7.2 2.36 7.94% $0.47 $0.94 17.37% Through a meticulous analysis of Apple, we can observe the following trends: The Price to Earnings ratio of 40.3 is 0.88x lower than the industry average, indicating potential undervaluation for the stock. It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 65.03 which exceeds the industry average by 9.03x . The Price to Sales ratio of 9.65 , which is 4.09x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% , which is 15.89% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential. Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 69.15x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 46.68x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly below the industry average of 17.37% . This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is an important measure to assess the financial structure and risk profile of a company. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When comparing Apple with its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be observed: When evaluating the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple is in the middle position among its top 4 peers. The company maintains a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , suggesting a relatively balanced financial structure. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is performing well financially but may face challenges in revenue expansion compared to industry peers.

2025-01-07 13:26:57,AAPL,"!Taiwan Semiconductor Ramps Up Production in Japan, US, and Germany to Diversify Away from China",BZ$19b3e08d,BZ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE: TSM ) is all set for full-capacity production in the U.S. and Germany after commercializing its debut Japanese chip plant in Kikuyo, Kumamoto Prefecture, last December. Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) $3 trillion valuation and Taiwan Semiconductor’s 2nm progress testify to AI-driven chip industry growth . Reportedly, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ) eyes $80 billion in developing AI data centers in fiscal 2025, marking a big win for the sector. Also Read: Taiwan Semiconductor’s Kaohsiung Expansion To Boost 2-nm Chip Production The contract chipmaker aims to complete production of plants in Arizona in 2025 and Dresden in 2027. Construction of Taiwan Semiconductor’s second Japanese factory will likely begin near the Kikuyo plant, the Japan News reports . Taiwan commanded 67% of the global market share in contracted semiconductor manufacturing and nearly 80% in cutting-edge products in 2023, the Japan News cites TrendForce. Taiwan attempted to shield itself from geopolitical tension by concentrating production on the island. Still, it also remains focused on its geographical diversification to help the world boost its semiconductor base by reducing its dependence on China, whose semiconductor supply chain was disrupted during the 2020 pandemic. Kumamoto Gov. Takashi Kimura shared with Japan Times the country’s hopes to attract Taiwan Semiconductor’s third plant in the prefecture. The new plant, located in Kikuyo, began commercializing 12-28 nm technology last December. It caters to Sony Group Corp (NYSE: SONY ), which produces camera sensors for Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Taiwan Semiconductor is proficient in making general-purpose chips between 12 and 28 nm. However, chip plants in Japan failed to produce semiconductors thinner than 40 nm, prompting them to tap the Taiwanese chipmaker. Taiwan Semiconductor is building a new plant in Arizona, where commercialization of 4-nm chips will likely begin between January and March. It aims to complete its debut European plant in Dresden in 2027. The plant targets a quadrupolar production plan with principal plants in Taiwan, Japan, the U.S., and Germany. Meanwhile, some concerns loom in the form of President-elect Donald Trump taking charge on January 20. The U.S. posted a significant trade deficit with Taiwan in 2023, prompting Trump to verbally attack the country during his presidential campaigns for allegedly depriving the U.S. of the semiconductor industry. He suggested redemption by slapping tariffs on Taiwan, which can increase the contract chipmaker’s production costs since labor costs in the U.S. are about 30% higher than in Taiwan. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 115% in the last 12 months. Goldman Sachs ‘ Bruce Lu projected another year of robust revenue growth for Taiwan Semiconductor in 2025E, 26.8%, following 29.4% revenue growth in 2024E (all in USD terms). Demand in leading-edge nodes, mainly supported by AI, backed this growth. Investors can gain exposure to companies that manufacture semiconductors through ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE: SSG ) and ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE: XSD ).

The decision was made over two months after the company dumped the premium virtual reality headset because it failed to gain traction, Verge cites UploadVR. Meta shared plans to keep selling the headset until 2024 or until it ran out of stock, whichever came first, triggering speculation of lackluster demand. Also Read: Goldman Sachs Backs Chinese Equities as Markets React to Economic Slowdown and Tariff Concerns Meta Quest Touch Pro Controllers, compatible with Quest 2 and 3, are still available for consumers . Earlier in 2024, Meta reduced the price of its Meta Quest 2 VR headset to $199, half of the original . Meta’s augmented and VR division, Reality Labs, reported a third-quarter earnings loss of $4.4 billion, marking the third consecutive quarterly loss for the segment in 2024. Previous quarters in 2024 had losses of $3.8 billion and $4.5 billion. In related AR/VR headset news, prior reports indicated Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was slashing production of its $3,500 Vision Pro headset and shifting focus toward a more affordable model for 2025 to penetrate a broader audience. Meta reportedly plans to integrate displays into Ray-Ban smart glasses by 2025. The $300 sunglasses project, in partnership with EssilorLuxottica (OTC: ESLOF ) (OTC: ESLOY ), could offer small screens to display notifications and responses from Meta’s virtual assistant. Meta is also fast-tracking the development of its prototype AR glasses, Orion. Meta’s smart glasses have become a fixture in 60% of Ray-Ban stores in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, outperforming conventional Ray-Ban models. Wall Street firms, including JMP Securities and Rosenblatt , expect Meta’s AI and VR initiatives to help it reach valuations like Apple’s. Meta stock surged 76% in the last 12 months.

Jim Cramer suggested investors may have overlooked the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) supplier while focusing on Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) CES 2025 presentation . What Happened : “People were looking for Nvidia’s Jensen Huang to give a big keynote this evening at CES but weren’t thinking partner (and Apple supplier) Hon Hai would have such big numbers,” Cramer wrote on X on Monday, questioning whether bears might try to downplay the significance of the results. People were looking for Nvidia's Jensen Huang to give a big keynote this evening at CES but weren't thinking partner (and Apple supplier) Hon Hai would have such big numbers. But will the bears come in to knock it down at the opening saying we already knew this (when we didn't)? — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) January 6, 2025 Gary Black , managing partner of The Future Fund LLC , predicted the strong performance could catalyze broader market movements. “Taiwan’s Foxconn reported strong 4Q results and provided robust 1Q guidance, triggering chip stock rally,” Black noted on X.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) has committed to updating its AI feature following a complaint from the BBC. What Happened: The tech giant acknowledged on Monday that its AI-generated news summaries on iPhones have been inaccurate, reported BBC.

2025-01-06 17:55:57,AAPL,"AI, Quantum, And Robotics in Focus &#x2013; All Eyes On Nvidia CEO Keynote",BZ$19b147a2,BZ,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. All Eyes On Nvidia An enlarged chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Note the following: This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of NVDA stock is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows that NVDA stock ran up on Friday in advance of the Consumer Electronics Shows (CES). The chart shows that in the early trade NVDA stock is further gaining. The chart shows NVDA stock is at the low band of the resistance zone. CES kicks off with a keynote address from Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang today at 6:30pm PST. Huang is usually positive about the future of Nvidia in his speeches. NVDA stock is running up in anticipation of Huang's keynote address. Prudent investors should pay attention to what Huang says and how he says, as it will likely be market moving.

The momo crowd is aggressively buying. They are focused on AI stocks. Adding to the buzz around AI today is positive earnings from Foxconn. Foxconn is a supplier for both Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia. Stocks of NVDA, ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ: ASML ), Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM ), Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ: AMAT ), Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ: SMCI ), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL ), Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE: VRT ), Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU ), SK Hynix (HXSCL, HXSCF), Infineon Technologies AG (OTC: IFNNY ), and STMicroelectronics NV (NYSE: STM ) are moving up Foxconn earnings.

Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. , NVDA, MSFT, Alphabet Inc Class C , Meta Platforms Inc , Tesla Inc , and AAPL. In the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 . Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust . The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust . The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF . Bitcoin Bitcoin is range bound. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report is very popular. The protection band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

2025-01-06 17:05:39,AAPL,"!Big Tech's Date With Antitrust: Alphabet, Meta, Amazon Brace For Legal Showdowns In 2025",BZ$19b10ccc,BZ,"The regulatory risk is ratcheting higher for mega-cap tech giants, with antitrust lawsuits and deadlines stacking up like dominoes. From Alphabet Inc ‘s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) courtroom battles to Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ) and Amazon.com Inc ‘s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) looming trials, JPMorgan sees the regulatory landscape for mega-cap tech firms set to intensify in 2025. Here's a chronological look at what's brewing, focusing on some of the pivotal antitrust cases and decisions spanning the next two years. Google: The DOJ's Prime Target Alphabet’s Google is in the crosshairs with three antitrust lawsuits. Jan. 24, 2023: The DOJ sued Google for monopolizing digital advertising technologies. The suit targets Google's ad-tech empire. Nov. 20, 2024: the DOJ proposed remedies to curb Google's dominance in search and advertising. Recommendations include divesting Chrome , revealing search query data, and stopping payouts to distributors like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Dec. 20, 2024: Google filed its counterproposals ahead of a spring trial. Final rulings are expected by August 2025 , with the tech giant planning to appeal. The stakes are high, with divestitures and sweeping behavioral remedies on the table, but Google's playbook includes appeals and push for its ecosystem's indispensable value.

Nov. 13, 2024: Judge James Boasberg allowed the FTC’s claim that Meta overpaid for Instagram and WhatsApp to stifle competition to proceed to trial. He, however, dismissed allegations of restricting third-party developers. Trial date is set for April 14, 2025. Meta faces fallout from its ""pay or consent"" advertising model in the EU and a $1.4 billion settlement over facial recognition privacy in Texas. Regulatory headaches continue as courts reexamine a 2019 FTC ruling on user data practices. Amazon: The Long Haul Amazon is prepping for a marathon legal battle with the FTC. Sep. 26, 2023: FTC sues Amazon , accusing it of illegally maintaining monopoly power. The FTC and 17 state attorneys general aim to dismantle Amazon's retail dominance, alleging the company blocks competition and inflates prices. Specifially the suit targets Amazon’s online stores and third party seller services. The trial is set for Oct. 13, 2026. A separate FTC lawsuit targeting Prime's enrollment practices heads to trial on June 9, 2025. Amazon argues its marketplace empowers third-party sellers and consumers and said the FTC overstates Amazon’s market influence. What Else Is On The Docket? Beyond these high-profile cases, regulators have their sights set on TikTok , which faces a Jan. 19 divestiture deadline, Apple and other gig economy players.

2025-01-06 15:00:32,AAPL,"Insights Into Apple's Performance Versus Peers In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Sector",BZ$19b08298,BZ,"In the ever-evolving and intensely competitive business landscape, conducting a thorough company analysis is of utmost importance for investors and industry followers. In this article, we will carry out an in-depth industry comparison, assessing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) alongside its primary competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By meticulously examining key financial metrics, market positioning, and growth prospects, we aim to offer valuable insights to investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 40.03 64.59 9.59 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.31 1.16 0.97 5.72% $1.44 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.54 26.65 3.82 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 70.41 1.90 1.49 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 164.69 14.85 7.43 4.44% $0.11 $0.58 8.94% Super Micro Computer Inc 16.59 3.57 1.34 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 9.69 0.56 0.59 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 56.55 3.46 1.04 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 23.43 0.98 0.59 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 46.78 6.64 2.16 7.36% $0.41 $0.82 22.64% By analyzing Apple, we can infer the following trends: A Price to Earnings ratio of 40.03 significantly below the industry average by 0.86x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth. With a Price to Book ratio of 64.59 , which is 9.73x the industry average, Apple might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers. The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.59 , surpassing the industry average by 4.44x , may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.47% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion is 79.27x above the industry average, highlighting stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. With a revenue growth of 6.07% , which is much lower than the industry average of 22.64% , the company is experiencing a notable slowdown in sales expansion. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a financial metric that helps determine the level of financial risk associated with a company's capital structure. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By considering the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple can be compared to its top 4 peers, leading to the following observations: Apple holds a middle position in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates a balanced financial structure with a moderate level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, despite slower revenue growth. Overall, Apple's financial performance is solid, with room for potential growth in the future. This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.

Investors expect Nvidia to offer positive pointers at CES, as Focus Taiwan cites MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang alluding to Nvidia chief Jenseng Huang ‘s keynote speech at the event. The semiconductor chip stocks had a remarkable run in 2024, backed by the AI frenzy, pivotal to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq index’s gains of 23%—29% in 2024. Last year, a third of the 10 global companies worth over $1 trillion valuation were from the chip industry. Notably, Nvidia’s valuation surged by over $2 trillion in 2024, breaching the $3 trillion mark. This was backed by its GPUs, which initially targeted video games but ended up being critical hardware for developing AI models. Broadcom joined the trillion-dollar club in 2024, supported by demand for its custom chips. Contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor remains on track to produce 2nm chips in Taiwan and commercialize 4nm chips at its Arizona fab. It is a key supplier to companies such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and more. Dan Ives of Wedbush expects tech stocks to post a 25% gain in 2025, backed by favorable policies from President-elect Donald Trump and Big Tech spending.

""we are currently losing money on openai pro subscriptions! people use it much more than we expected,"" he said. insane thing: we are currently losing money on openai pro subscriptions! people use it much more than we expected. — Sam Altman (@sama) January 6, 2025 OpenAI launched ChatGPT Pro late last year to offer its users an upgraded experience.

However, Billionaire and OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk has filed for an injunction to halt the transition, accusing OpenAI of deviating from its original mission . In 2023, the company projected losses of about $5 billion on $3.7 billion in revenue. High operating expenses, including costs of approximately $700,000 per day to support the ChatGPT platform, are contributing to its financial struggles. To counter these losses, OpenAI is exploring strategies to become profitable. One potential solution involves increasing the price of its subscription tiers. In December, OpenAI said it is planning to reach 1 billion users by 2025, driven by new AI products, infrastructure and partnership with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Also, Sam Altman shared his thoughts in a blog post regarding the company's ongoing efforts to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) and its eventual goal of superintelligence . ""With superintelligence, we can do anything else. Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.""

2025-01-05 13:33:16,AAPL,"!Investment Guru Peter Lynch: 'If You Invest Only in an Index, You'll Never Beat It. Brushing Up on Stock-Picking Skills Is Wise'",BZ$19af1046,BZ,"Esteemed investor Peter Lynch , celebrated for his extraordinary 13-year tenure managing the Fidelity Magellan fund has shared his investment insights and views on the evolving stock market landscape . What Happened: Lynch, whose impressive 29% annualized return from 1977 to 1990 still stands, discussed his investment tactics and the transformation of the stock market. He stressed the significance of investing in sectors and companies that investors are familiar with, advising, “Invest in what you know.” Lynch’s successful career has had a profound impact on American investment practices, with 55% of Americans now holding stocks, either directly or through retirement accounts and mutual funds. Despite the significant shifts in the investment world since Lynch’s era at Magellan, his legacy endures. He continues to guide stock analysts at Fidelity, the prominent investment firm based in Boston. However, Lynch recognized the hurdles confronting today’s investors. With over 5,000 stock indexes and thousands of passive funds based on these, he pondered whether stock pickers can still offer unique insights into large corporations. According to a report by Barron’s, Lynch maintains a positive outlook on the U.S. stock market, encouraging investors to purchase stocks irrespective of market conditions. He also underscored the importance of company fundamentals, such as earnings growth, inventory growth rates, and debt-to-equity ratios. Also Read: Investment Guru Peter Lynch: ‘If You Can’t Explain To An 11-Year-Old In 2 Minutes Or Less Why You Own The Stock, You Shouldn’t Own It’ Lynch says that, “if you invest only in an index, you'll never beat it. If you buy today's widespread notion that stock market returns will be generally lower in the future, brushing up on your stock-picking skills is wise.” Despite his numerous triumphs, Lynch also confessed to making errors, notably in the technology sector. However, he is of the view that these mistakes have been counterbalanced by his profitable investments. Why It Matters: Lynch’s advice to “invest in what you know” underscores the importance of familiarity and understanding in investment decisions. His successful career and enduring influence on American investment habits highlight the potential benefits of this approach. However, the evolving investment landscape, with its increasing complexity and the rise of passive funds, poses new challenges for investors. Lynch’s insights provide valuable guidance for navigating these challenges, emphasizing the importance of company fundamentals and a positive, long-term outlook.

Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool Honorable Mentions: The following stocks were the 11 th to 20 th most-searched tickers on Benzinga Pro in 2024 and their ranking in the first half of 2024. 11. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ): 11 th 12. MARA Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA ): 8 th 13. Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ): Not in Top 20 14. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ): 14 th 15.

MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR ): Not in Top 20 20. Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC ): Not in Top 20 Why It's Important: Nvidia takes the crown as the most-searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in 2024, which comes as the stock often ranked in the top three on a monthly basis. With a gain of over 170% in 2024, Nvidia was one of the top performing S&P 500 stocks. Nvidia also briefly became the most valuable company in the world multiple times in 2024. Tesla ranked second for searches, which isn't a huge surprise given the company's loyal fan base and the stock ranking among the top three most months, including multiple months in first month. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which is the largest ETF, ranked third for the year, which comes after the ETF ranked second in the first half of 2024 and was passed by Tesla to end the year. The ETF has often been a top performer on Benzinga Pro searches over the years. Super Micro Computer ranked fourth for the year as it was one of the most widely followed stories of a soaring stock that later attracted short reports and concerns for fraud and accounting irregularities. Apple ranked fifth, but the stock could move down the list in 2025 if trends hold. Apple was ranked outside of the top 20 in the month of December, which is rather unusual for the world's most valuable company. Palantir rose in the second half of 2024 for Benzinga Pro searches going from 10 th in the first half of the year to end the year ranked seventh. A huge gain in the company's share price likely contributed. Another top storyline in 2024 was the return of Roaring Kitty, aka Keith Gill , to social media , which sent shares of GameStop soaring in several months of 2024. The stock ranked seventh for searches in the first half. While the stock has not been as popular in the later months of 2024, GameStop ended the year as the 10 th most-searched ticker and shares were up 88%. A soaring price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) in 2024 helped lead to several crypto related stocks soar in interest in the later half of 2024 and overall on the year. Bitcoin hit new all-time highs after the 2024 election and hit the $100,000 milestone in December 2024. MARA Holdings, Coinbase and MicroStrategy all ranked among the top 20 searched tickers for the year. Trump Media & Technology, which is a media company co-founded by President-elect Donald Trump , ranked 13 th on the year. The stock saw a surge in price and huge interest as the 2024 election neared before shares fell and interest minimized after his win. Overall, the 2024 year saw nine of the top 10 most-searched tickers in the first six months of 2024 remain the most-searched tickers for the year with Amazon.com moving into the top 10 and MARA moving down to 12 th place. Of the top 20 most-searched tickers for the full year, 16 were among the 20 most-searched tickers for the first half of the year.

2025-01-03 18:28:31,AAPL,"!Nvidia's $2 Trillion AI Rally In 2024 Fueled by Chips, Startups, and Robotics",BZ$19ad26c9,BZ,"The artificial intelligence frenzy and demand for its AI-centric chips catapulted Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) into the trillion-dollar market cap club for 2024. It lags behind Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which was backed by investor curiosity over its potential AI offerings, turbocharging its iPhone sales. Reuters reports that Nvidia’s valuation surged by over $2 trillion in 2024, reaching over $3 trillion, making it the second-most valuable public company. It owes its success to its GPUs, which were previously targeted at video games but ultimately transformed into critical hardware for developing AI models. Also Read: What’s Going On With Taiwan Semiconductor Stock On Friday? According to the report, Nvidia invested $1 billion across 50 startup funding rounds in 2024 (versus $872 million in 2023), including Elon Musk’s xAI. It also acquired multiple AI players, including Run:ai, Nebulon, and OctoAI. Nvidia eyes robotics as a growth catalyst amid rising AI competition. The chip designer plans to introduce Jetson Thor computers for humanoid robots in 2025, coinciding with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) targeting the availability of its humanoid robot, Optimus, by 2026. Other trillion-dollar tech companies included Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO ) entered the trillion-dollar club in 2024, backed by demand for its custom chips from the U.S. Big Tech giants. In 2024, a third of the ten global companies worth over $1 trillion came from the chip industry. These companies were instrumental in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq index’s surge of 23%—29% in 2024, backed by investor and analyst enthusiasm despite Donald Trump’s tariff threat and U.S. interest rate concerns. Daniel Ives of Wedbush told Reuters he expects tech stocks to post a 25% gain in 2025, citing favorable regulatory policies under Donald Trump, AI capital expenditures, and more. Nvidia stock surged 203% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH ) and Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (NYSE: FTEC ).

2025-01-03 16:27:52,AAPL,"!Apple iPhones Lose Ground In China As Subsidies Boost Huawei, Domestic Rivals",BZ$19aca28f,BZ,"November shipments of foreign-made phones in China plummeted as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) struggles to maintain market share in the face of China's government subsidies and support of its domestic brands. What To Know: Foreign mobile phone shipments in China came in at 3.04 million units for November, a drop of 47.4% from the same month last year according to CNBC calculations based on data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. The CAICT data is not detailed by brand. However, Apple accounts for the majority of foreign-made phone shipments in the country. The significant drop in shipments highlights the increasing popularity of domestic brands in the world's largest smartphone market. Read Next: Russian Natural Gas Delivery To Europe Halted: US-Listed LNG Stocks Gain As Exports Set To Increase In 2025 Why It Matters: Apple’s iPhones are facing tough competition from China's local brands, including Vivo's X200 Pro flagship model, Huawei's next-gen Mate device, as well as upcoming models from Xiaomi and Oppo. On Friday, China announced the expansion of government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics.The subsidies, aimed at resuscitating China's struggling economy, are expected to benefit domestic brands like Huawei Technologies Co . and Xiaomi Corp. (OTC: XIACY ). Apple's smartphone sales in China fell 0.3% year-on-year in the third quarter, leaving it with a 15.6% market share. In contrast, Huawei saw remarkable growth of 42% in market share, reaching 15.3%, and Vivo claimed the top spot in September with a 19% share. Underscoring the intensity of competition in the Chinese market, Apple on Thursday announced a rare promotional event in China, set to run from Jan. 4 to Jan. 7. The tech giant will offer discounts on several iPhone 16 models, with the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max seeing reductions of up to $68.50 and the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will drop by $54.80.

2025-01-03 15:00:37,AAPL,"Evaluating Apple Against Peers In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$19ac5f3e,BZ,"In the dynamic and fiercely competitive business environment, conducting a thorough analysis of companies is crucial for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will perform an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in relation to its major competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By closely examining crucial financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to offer valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 40.11 64.72 9.61 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.12 1.14 0.95 5.72% $1.44 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.35 26.42 3.79 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 67.99 1.84 1.44 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 160.23 14.45 7.23 4.44% $0.11 $0.58 8.81% Super Micro Computer Inc 14.96 3.22 1.21 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 9.60 0.55 0.59 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 55 3.36 1.01 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 22.76 0.95 0.57 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 45.38 6.49 2.1 7.36% $0.41 $0.82 22.62% By conducting a comprehensive analysis of Apple, the following trends become evident: A Price to Earnings ratio of 40.11 significantly below the industry average by 0.88x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth. With a Price to Book ratio of 64.72 , which is 9.97x the industry average, Apple might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers. With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.61 , which is 4.58x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.47% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. With higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 79.27x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The gross profit of $43.88 Billion is 53.51x above that of its industry, highlighting stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 6.07% compared to the industry average of 22.62% , which indicates a challenging sales environment. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a key indicator of a company's financial health and its reliance on debt financing. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When examining Apple in comparison to its top 4 peers with respect to the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following information becomes apparent: Apple holds a middle position in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates a balanced financial structure with a moderate level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The PB and PS ratios are high, suggesting a premium valuation relative to industry peers. In terms of ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit, Apple demonstrates strong performance with high figures, reflecting efficient operations and profitability. However, the low revenue growth rate may raise concerns about the company's ability to expand its market share compared to industry peers.

2025-01-03 14:58:58,AAPL,"!Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia Push Vanguard's Low-Cost S&P 500 ETF Higher",BZ$19ac5e50,BZ,"The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO ), with over $572.79 billion in assets under management, is an investment titan, offering exposure to the U.S. large-cap equity market . Launched in September 2010, Vanguard happens to be one of the most low-cost ETFs that have an expense ratio of just 0.03%. As a passively managed fund, it mirrors the performance of the S&P 500, a benchmark index for U.S. large-cap stocks. Large-cap stocks, with market capitalizations surpassing $10 billion, are known for stability, predictable cash flows and relatively low volatility. Vanguard balances growth and value stocks, allowing investors to spread out risks and returns. See Also: Unity Stock Jumps As Roaring Kitty’s Meme Magic Meets Technical Uncertainty Top Holdings Vanguard’s portfolio is concentrated in the Information Technology sector, accounting for 32.4% of its assets. Three of the world's most valuable companies stand atop its holdings: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Together, these three companies account for 19.88% of Vanguard’s total assets and have a big impact on the returns generated by the ETF. Apple is the ETF's largest holding, with 7.06% allocation to the fund (according to Vanguard ETFs' data from Nov. 30, 2024). However, the tech titan faces challenges. UBS analysts recently gave Apple a neutral rating with a price target of $236, citing weaker-than-expected iPhone sales. Dwindling demand and declining market share in China have raised concerns, particularly during the critical holiday sales season. Nonetheless, Apple holds a consensus ‘buy’ rating from 30 analysts, with a price target of $245.27 per share, according to Benzinga Pro . It shows that Apple is still a strong long-term player. Coming to Nvidia, the chipmaker is riding the artificial intelligence wave, with its stock climbing more than 180% in 2024. The firm’s market cap reached a high of $3.29 trillion, an amount that threatens to close the gap with the $3.79 trillion of Apple. At this rate, if Nvidia does not lose momentum in 2025, one might speculate that it could once again challenge Apple as the most valuable company in the world. Microsoft also continues to thrive on many fronts. Its near-monopoly on in-office software with Office and Dynamics 365, coupled with the dominance of LinkedIn, has cemented its position. The company’s cloud-based solutions, including Azure, OpenAI, and GitHub, remain key growth drivers. Vanguard's Stellar Performance and Outlook Vanguard has been a top performer, with the market price growing almost 25% in 2024, outpacing the S&P 500’s 23% gain. This impressive performance reflects its focus on high-growth companies, particularly in technology. While the S&P 500 has typically been averaging an annual return of around 10% since 1965, according to Berkshire Hathaway data, Vanguard's targeted strategy on growth stocks within the index gives it an edge. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers investors a cost-efficient way to tap into the U.S. equity market’s largest and most stable companies.

However, The Kobeissi Letter revealed a concerning trend on Thursday. What Happened : The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 are now nearly 800 times larger than the 75th percentile stock, surpassing the concentration levels seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s. This current concentration is also 50% more intense than in 2001. The dominance of a few major companies within the S&P 500 raises concerns about the potential risks associated with such concentration. Shocking stat of the day: The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 are now almost 800 TIMES larger than the 75th percentile stock. Not even the Great Depression in the 1930s saw market concentration this high. It's now 50% MORE concentrated than 2001. pic.twitter.com/vhbw1DprQ0 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 2, 2025 The Kobeissi Letter’s findings coincide with warnings from billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya , who highlighted the risks of the S&P 500’s concentration. Palihapitiya pointed out that the top ten stocks account for 40% of the index’s market capitalization, which could lead to significant issues if market volatility arises. He warned that the lack of diversification might result in “massive impairment” during turbulent times. See Also: Elon Musk Changes His Name To ‘Kekius Maximus’ On X, Sending This Memecoin Skyrocketing Over 600% Why It Matters : The increasing concentration within the S&P 500 index is a significant development in financial markets. Over the years, the dominance of a few large companies has been growing, leading to concerns about the implications for investors and the broader market. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend as tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) saw substantial growth, further skewing the index’s balance. In 2021, analysts began to note the potential risks associated with this concentration, warning that any significant downturn in these leading stocks could have outsized effects on the index’s performance. This concern has been echoed by financial experts who emphasize the importance of diversification to mitigate risks. Price Action: As per Benzinga Pro , SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) fell 3.19% in the past month while Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ) dropped by 1.28%, as of last closing session.

(NASDAQ: MSFT ) is broadening its artificial intelligence hardware strategy with a new wave of compact desktop computers featuring dedicated Copilot capabilities, as manufacturers prepare to showcase their latest offerings at the Consumer Electronics Show next week. What Happened : Asus has emerged as the first major manufacturer to unveil a Copilot Plus-compatible mini PC, announcing its NUC 14 Pro AI model with a dedicated Copilot button, reported The Verge. The device, comparable in size to Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Mac Mini, signals Microsoft’s push to expand its AI features beyond laptops . Taiwanese manufacturer Geekom is joining the initiative with three new mini PCs, including models powered by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ‘s (NYSE: AMD ) Strix Point CPUs and Qualcomm Inc. ‘s (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon X Elite processor. Both processors meet Microsoft’s requirements for Copilot Plus features, which include advanced capabilities like AI-powered image generation and editing. The mini PC developments follow Microsoft’s successful initiative last year to incorporate Copilot keys on laptop keyboards. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri indicated in an October interview with Notepad that AI advancement would drive new hardware innovation.

Yusuf Mehdi , Microsoft’s executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, recently highlighted the company’s interest in AI-powered wearable devices, particularly in health-related applications. This aligns with the company’s recent establishment of an AI health unit under Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC ) released its Core Ultra desktop CPU in October, though it fell short of Microsoft’s 40 TOPS requirement for Copilot Plus features.

2025-01-03 03:59:46,AAPL,Apple Settles $95 Million Lawsuit Over Siri Privacy Violations: Here's The Amount Affected Users Will Receive,BZ$19ab48ff,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit alleging its Siri voice assistant recorded users’ private conversations without consent, according to court documents filed Tuesday at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. What Happened : The preliminary settlement could benefit millions of U.S. consumers who owned Apple devices between September 2014 and December 2024, Reuters reported. Eligible users can receive up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with a limit of five claims per person. Approved claimants should receive payments within 60 days of filing. The lawsuit stemmed from user complaints that Siri would accidentally activate and record private conversations, which allegedly resulted in targeted advertising. Users claimed Apple shared these recordings with third-party companies, though Apple has denied these privacy violation allegations. See Also: Carvana, Unity Software, SuperCom, Rigetti Computing, Tesla: Why These 5 Stocks Are On Investors’ Radars Today Why It Matters : As part of the settlement, Apple must delete any unauthorized recordings made before October 2019 within six months of the agreement’s effective date.

In late 2023, Google settled a similar lawsuit for $700 million over unauthorized recordings by its voice assistant .

2025-01-03 03:30:22,AAPL,"Biden-Era Net Neutrality Rules Overturned By Federal Appeals Court: What It Means For Net Freedom, Cybersecurity And Consumers",BZ$19ab3576,BZ,"On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit struck down the Federal Communications Commission’s net neutrality rules. What Happened: This decision represents a major policy win for Republicans and poses a challenge to the Joe Biden administration’s internet regulation agenda. Democrats have been advocating for stricter controls akin to those on traditional telephone networks, while Republicans favor a more relaxed approach. The 6th Circuit judges referenced a Supreme Court ruling from June that struck down the Chevron deference principle, enabling them to question the FCC’s authority. Chevron deference refers to the flexibility federal judges grant agencies in interpreting the statutes they oversee when disputes occur.

FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has called on Congress to legislate open internet principles. Brendan Carr , President-elect Donald Trump -appointed FCC chairman, praised the court’s decision and promised further deregulatory actions. ""The work to unwind the Biden Administration's regulatory overreach will continue,"" he said, reported The Washington Post. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: Net neutrality is based on the principle that internet service providers like Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ), and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) are required to treat all internet traffic equally, ensuring uniform speed and access, no matter which company is behind the content. Supporters of net neutrality argue that these rules are crucial to prevent internet service providers from abusing their power, such as throttling access to certain websites. Critics, however, say there’s little evidence of such discrimination and warn that increased regulation could hinder innovation. Previously, the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which counts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) among its members, supported the reinstatement of the rules, stating that they are necessary to maintain open internet access. Price Action: According to data from Benzinga Pro , Comcast’s stock dropped 0.29% on Thursday, while AT&T rose by 0.26% and Verizon increased by 0.55%.

2025-01-02 19:25:09,AAPL,!Some Investors Are Selling Apple Stock Thursday: Here's Why,BZ$19a9f4f0,BZ,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares are trading lower Thursday following reports indicating the tech giant is offering discounts on several iPhone models in China . What Happened: Apple is running a four-day promotional period, discounting iPhone 16 models in China by up to 500 yuan ($68.50) from Jan. 4 to Jan. 7, according to Reuters. The report indicates that the discounts apply to multiple iPhone models and are available for customers using specific payment methods like WeChat Pay and Alipay. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models will be discounted by 500 yuan, while the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models will be discounted by 400 yuan. Apple will also offer discounts of 200 to 300 yuan on older iPhone models and other device categories. Related Link: Tech Predictions 2025: Apple’s Edge AI Drive, M&A Heat, Cloud Hardware Shift Apple is reportedly battling market share declines as local competition intensifies in China, which is the world’s biggest smartphone market. Chinese tech giant Huawei is one of the companies taking share from Apple in the region since it launched a premium challenger in August 2023. Huawei also reportedly slashed prices on phones and other high-end tech devices by as much as 3,000 yuan this past weekend. Apple’s China sales fell 0.3% year-over-year in the third quarter, while Huawei sales jumped 42%, the report states, citing research firm IDC. UBS analysts lowered their iPhone sales outlook for December on Thursday due to declining market share in China. The firm maintained a Neutral rating and price target of $236 after cutting revenue estimates for the quarter by about 2%. The selloff in Apple shares on Thursday may also be partly due to profit taking given that the stock rallied roughly 35% to all-time highs in 2024. Some investors may have been waiting until January to take profits for tax purposes.

2025-01-02 15:00:28,AAPL,"Assessing Apple's Performance Against Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$19a98272,BZ,"In today's rapidly changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, it is vital for investors and industry enthusiasts to carefully evaluate companies. In this article, we will perform a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) against its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing important financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 41.19 66.47 9.87 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.06 1.13 0.95 5.72% $1.44 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.38 26.46 3.79 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 65.53 1.77 1.39 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 157.51 14.21 7.11 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Super Micro Computer Inc 15.17 3.26 1.23 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 9.39 0.54 0.57 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 55.84 3.41 1.03 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 23.55 0.98 0.59 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 44.93 6.47 2.08 7.36% $0.41 $0.82 22.62% After thoroughly examining Apple, the following trends can be inferred: At 41.19 , the stock's Price to Earnings ratio is 0.92x less than the industry average, suggesting favorable growth potential. It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 66.47 which exceeds the industry average by 10.27x . The Price to Sales ratio of 9.87 , which is 4.75x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.47% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. With higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 79.27x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly below the industry average of 22.62% . This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio gauges the extent to which a company has financed its operations through debt relative to equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When evaluating Apple alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise: As Apple is in the middle of the list in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, it suggests that the company has a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 compared to the other companies. This position indicates a relatively balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a reasonable level of debt while also leveraging equity for financing its operations. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, despite slower revenue growth. Overall, Apple's financial performance is solid, with room for potential growth in the future. This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.

2025-01-02 14:16:51,AAPL,"!Tech Predictions 2025: Apple's Edge AI Drive, M&A Heat, Cloud Hardware Shift",BZ$19a97689,BZ,"The tech world in 2025 is set to be defined by resilience, consolidation, and the unstoppable rise of Edge AI . JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee has unveiled his top predictions for hardware and networking in 2025, and it's clear: the year will be all about resilience, edge AI, and a few surprising twists. Here's what investors need to know. Apple, Edge AI: 2 Hot Tickets For 2025 Chatterjee is betting on Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to flex its muscles. He sees iPhone 17 hype and the rise of Edge AI keeping investors hooked. Forget the valuation debates—AI integration in smartphones and PCs could make Apple untouchable for much of the year. While hyperscalers may grapple with AI scaling debates, Edge AI will steal the spotlight. By December, expect it to solidify as the darling of the tech world, powering smarter gadgets and keeping investors excited well into 2026. AI's ROI remains focused on cost-cutting rather than driving revenue gains. Enterprises will stick to the basics, leveraging AI for leaner operations rather than headline-grabbing revenue boosts, the analyst said. Read Also: Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, And More: Tech Moguls Post Upbeat New Year Greetings: ‘Have A Good Feeling About 2025’ Cloud Wars Favor Hardware The long-running tug-of-war between on-premise and cloud infrastructure tilts toward hardware in 2025. According to Chatterjee, companies like Dell Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: DELL ) and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO ) could shrug off fears of cloud dominance as enterprises reconsider the cloud's ROI for AI workloads. AI Stocks: A Rollercoaster Ride It won't be smooth sailing for AI-leveraged players like Arista Networks Inc (NYSE: ANET ) and Coherent Corp (NYSE: COHR ), per Chatterjee. Early-year uncertainty will weigh on shares until mid-year earnings provide clarity. Investors will wait for the likes of Nvidia Corp 's (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Blackwell and 800G Ethernet switching to gain traction. Valuation Squeeze, Cyclicality To Spark M&A Frenzy Premium valuations across the hardware sector will narrow the gap between winners and laggards, says Chatterjee. The year's theme? Find value in the underdogs or wait for M&A opportunities to unlock hidden potential. As Telco, enterprise, and cable players gear up for a cyclical rebound, consolidation could heat up. Chatterjee predicts stronger players will snap up rivals to amplify recovery gains and slash costs. Contract Manufacturers: The New Favorites Historically overshadowed by OEMs, contract manufacturers are ready to shine. Lower risks, better margins, and ties to AI infrastructure projects could make them 2025's surprise winners. Tariff Troubles Overblown Worried about tariffs? Don't be. Chatterjee expects years of supply chain investments to shield companies from the worst, leaving doomsayers scratching their heads as stocks rise. EV, AV: Hype Fatigue Sets In Electric and autonomous vehicles will face another year of growing pains. With U.S. EV subsidies on shaky ground and slower progress in autonomous tech, optimism might fizzle—except for robotaxis, which could gain traction in tightly controlled spaces, says Chatterjee. JPMorgan's vision for 2025 is clear: edge AI is the growth engine, Apple stays unstoppable, and consolidation could define the year. For investors, it's a roadmap to navigate the tech sector's next big moves.

2025-01-02 13:09:29,AAPL,"!Broadcom Thrives with 114% Stock Surge in AI Boom, While Intel Faces Steep Decline",BZ$19a95d9f,BZ,"The year 2024 proved very eventful for the semiconductor companies in the U.S. tech sector. It rewarded those, including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO ), that successfully tapped the artificial intelligence wave while punishing those that failed, like Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC ). A third of the ten global companies worth over $1 trillion came from the chip industry, Bloomberg reports . Also Read: Nvidia Completes Run:ai Buyout: Details In 2024, Broadcom joined Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE: TSM ) and Nvidia in the coveted Trillion club. Broadcom stock surged 114%, while Intel plunged 58% in the last 12 months, underscoring the strategies that worked or failed for the companies. Broadcom develops custom chips for U.S. Big Tech companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Google , Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Contract chipmaker Intel lost out on mobile chips to Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ: ARM ), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ), CNBC reports . Nvidia proved to be another nemesis for Intel after the former’s GPUs, targeted at video games, have transformed into critical hardware for developing AI models. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: AMD ) also started snatching market share in the PC and server CPU markets by tapping Taiwan Semiconductor, which proved a triple whammy for Intel. All of which rendered Intel’s CPU, formerly the most significant and expensive part of a server, redundant in an AI server. Nvidia GPUs meant for 2025 do not need an Intel CPU. Meanwhile, Broadcom emerged as the second most valuable chip company after Nvidia, which reached a $3.4 trillion valuation thanks to the AI frenzy, gaining 179% in the last 12 months. Once the most valuable chipmaker, Intel saw its valuation tumble from a $300 billion market cap in 2020 to $85 billion in 2024, prompting it to downsize its workforce, fire veteran CEO Pat Gelsinger, and potentially divest core parts of its business. Nvidia replaced it in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Investors continue to reward Broadcom for its more straightforward and affordable XPUs than Nvidia’s GPUs. On the company’s earnings call, Broadcom chief Hock E. Tan shared plans to double shipments of its XPUs to its three hyperscale providers, including Google and, reportedly, TikTok parent ByteDance and Meta. Tan expects the companies to incur $60 billion—$90 billion in XPU capital expenditures in the next two years. Broadcom expects AI revenue to constitute 65% of its revenue in the first quarter from 40% in the fourth quarter. Tan projected a decade-long sustained AI demand backed by Big Tech ambitions, citing investments by OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI. Rosenblatt’s Hans Mosesmann expects Broadcom’s custom-chip (ASIC) AI abilities and surging AI demand to boost rivalry with AMD and Nvidia. In 2025, Intel will release a new AI chip dubbed Falcon Shores. Intel had divulged plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit and does not expect meaningful sales from outside customers until 2027. Goldman Sachs’ Toshiya Hari, Benchmark’s Cody Acree, Needham’s N. Quinn Bolton, Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer, and KeyBanc’s John Vinh flagged Intel’s competitive pressures and margin challenges on the back of modest revenue growth. Investors can gain exposure to the semiconductor sector through VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH ) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX ). Price Actions: At last check Thursday, AVGO stock was up 2.45% at $237.51 premarket, while INTC stock was up 1.20%.

2025-01-02 11:22:23,AAPL,"!UBS Cuts iPhone Sales Forecast For December Amid Stiff Competition From Rivals, Maintains Neutral Rating",BZ$19a92c64,BZ,"After Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) market share fell in China in the third quarter of 2024, UBS has forecast weaker iPhone sales in the month of December. What Happened: UBS analyst David Vogt , has lowered iPhone sales forecast for December, citing declining demand and falling market share in China. The brokerage expects weaker iPhone sales to impact Apple’s overall revenue and earnings in the quarter. The revised sales forecast led to a 2% downward revision in UBS’s revenue estimates for the quarter and a lower EPS forecast. According to UBS, Apple faces intensifying competition from Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi. The analyst maintains a ‘neutral’ rating with a price target of $236 per share. Why It Matters: Apple’s new intelligence features for the iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 updates are expected to boost sales as it enters other geographies in 2025. However, Apple’s Chinese competitor Huawei has announced heavy discounts for the New Year on their premium models, challenging the former’s sales performance in this key market. Apple’s smartphone sales in China slightly declined in the third quarter, resulting in a 15.6% market share. Meanwhile, Huawei significantly increased its market share to 15.3%, while Vivo took the top spot with 18.6%. See Also: Apple’s Chinese Rival Huawei Slashes Prices For New Year Boost: Should Tim Cook-Led Company Be Worried? Here’s What Analysts Are Saying About AAPL Stock What Are Other Analysts Saying: According to Benzinga , AAPL has a consensus ‘buy' rating with a price target of $245.27 per share based on the ratings of 30 analysts. The highest price target out of all the analysts tracked by Benzinga is $325 issued by Wedbush Securities maintaining its ‘outperform’ rating on Dec. 26, 2024. Wedbush Securities projects a 26% upside for Apple stock, driven by an AI-fueled iPhone upgrade cycle expected to last through 2025. Raising price target on Apple to $325 as a golden era of growth for Cupertino is now on the horizon into 2025. We believe Apple is heading into a multi-year AI driven iPhone upgrade cycle still being underestimated by the Street. The consumer AI Revolution goes thru 🍎 🔥🐂🍎🍏 — Dan Ives (@DivesTech) December 26, 2024 Morgan Stanley reiterated its ‘overweight’ rating, citing AI as a key driver for iPhone upgrades in fiscal 2025. Barclays maintains an ‘underweight’ rating with the lowest target price of $184 apiece, citing concerns over delayed ChatGPT integration, staggered launches, muted initial enthusiasm, China market challenges, regulatory hurdles, and competition from Huawei’s 5G phones. The average price target of $286 between Wedbush, Morgan Stanley, and Needham implies a 14.21% upside for the Tim Cook-led company.

2025-01-02 08:13:45,AAPL,Apple Discounts iPhone 16 Prices In China By Up To $68.5 As It Battles Huawei's Resurgence In The Country,BZ$19a8c325,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is offering discounts of up to 500 yuan ($68.50) on its iPhone 16 models in China as it faces increasing competition from Huawei Technologies . What Happened: Apple has launched a rare promotional event in China, set to run from Jan. 4 to Jan. 7, 2025, reported Reuters. During this period, the tech giant will offer discounts on several iPhone 16 models, with the i Phone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max seeing reductions of up to 500 yuan, while the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will drop by 400 yuan ($54.80). See Also: Apple, Amazon, Samsung, And Nintendo: What Tech Marvels Are These Giants Cooking In 2025 The promotion also offers reductions ranging from 200 yuan ($27.40) to 300 yuan ($41.10) on older iPhone models, along with discounts on other products like MacBooks and iPads . However, these discounts are conditional on using certain payment methods, such as WeChat Pay or Alipay . Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: In October 2024, it was reported that Apple’s latest smartphone saw a 20% year-on-year increase in sales during its first three weeks, surpassing the performance of the previous iPhone model. Moreover, the move towards premium models boosted sales of the high-end Pro and Pro Max versions by 44% compared to the previous year. However, iPhones continue to face tough competition from China’s local brands, including Vivo’s X200 Pro flagship, Huawei’s next-gen Mate device, as well as upcoming models from Xiaomi and Oppo . Later during the same month, Cupertino slashed iPhone 16 series prices by as much as 1,600 yuan ($225) on the Tmall store, owned by Alibaba Group Holding . This discount was to drive sales during Singles' Day, the largest shopping event globally. Apple launched a 500-yuan discount voucher for all iPhone 16 models, while Tmall offered a trade-in subsidy of up to 1,100 yuan, enabling customers to save up to 1,600 yuan. Last month, Huawei also launched significant New Year discounts on its premium models . The company offered up to 3,000 yuan ($411) off on its top-selling products, including smartphones, headphones, watches, and tablets. Apple’s smartphone sales in China fell 0.3% year-on-year in the third quarter, leaving it with a 15.6% market share. In contrast, Huawei saw a 42% surge in market share, reaching 15.3%. Price Action: In 2024, Apple’s stock rose 34.9%, outpacing the NASDAQ 100, which gained 27.01% during the same period, according to Benzinga Pro data .

2025-01-01 18:00:19,AAPL,"!Warren Buffett Says Buy S&P 500, But This Tech Investor Warns Of A 'Rude Awakening'",BZ$19a81a8b,BZ,"Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has questioned the long-standing advice of Warren Buffett to invest in low-fee S&P 500 index funds. Palihapitiya warns of potential risks due to the index’s heavy concentration in a few tech stocks. What Happened : Buffett has consistently recommended that the average person invest in a low-fee S&P 500 index fund and hold it for the long term. However, Palihapitiya, co-host of the “All-In” podcast, contends that a handful of tech stocks have become so valuable that owning the S&P 500 is essentially a concentrated bet on these risky businesses. Palihapitiya’s concern is that the top 10 most valuable S&P 500 companies, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), account for nearly 40% of the benchmark index’s total market cap. This, he argues, contradicts the diversification principle that underpins index investing. “When you buy an index of 500 companies, you’re really buying 10 companies with 490 others thrown in,” Palihapitiya said in the X post on Saturday. Also Read: Warren Buffett’s Timeless Advice For Investing $10,000: ‘If You’re Gonna Do Dumb Things Because Your Stock Goes Down, You Shouldn’t Own A Stock At All’ “Average Americans buy S&P 500 index ETFs, in part, because Buffett told them to. They were told they would pay very little and get diversification in the 500 best companies on earth to ride out storms,” he said in the post. “That's ok if you're a ""professional"" and that's what you are betting on but most ETF buyers aren't professional stock traders and they will be in for a rude awakening if this isn't addressed,” Palihapitiya wrote. This needs to be fixed or it will end in disaster. Why? Average Americans buy S&P 500 index ETFs, in part, because Buffett told them to. They were told they would pay very little and get diversification in the 500 best companies on earth to ride out storms. But as… https://t.co/YEYhjvrSg7 — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) December 28, 2024 He warns that if these tech giants take a hit, investors could face significant losses, as their portfolios won’t be sufficiently cushioned by other holdings. Why It Matters : Palihapitiya’s critique of Buffett’s investment strategy comes amidst his own controversial promotion of high-risk special purpose acquisition deals, or SPACs, during the pandemic. Buffett, on the other hand, has largely avoided tech stocks throughout his career, focusing on value investing within his circle of competence. This divergence in investment approaches underscores the ongoing debate about the role of tech stocks in portfolio diversification and the potential risks associated with over-reliance on a few high-performing companies.

2025-01-01 15:00:27,AAPL,"Competitor Analysis: Evaluating Apple And Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$19a80aa3,BZ,"In the ever-evolving and intensely competitive business landscape, conducting a thorough company analysis is of utmost importance for investors and industry followers. In this article, we will carry out an in-depth industry comparison, assessing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) alongside its primary competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By meticulously examining key financial metrics, market positioning, and growth prospects, we aim to offer valuable insights to investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 41.48 66.94 9.94 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.09 1.13 0.95 5.72% $1.44 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.45 26.55 3.81 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 65.52 1.77 1.39 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 160.21 14.45 7.23 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Super Micro Computer Inc 15.27 3.28 1.24 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 9.79 0.56 0.60 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 55.13 3.37 1.02 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 24.08 1 0.61 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 45.32 6.51 2.11 7.36% $0.41 $0.82 22.62% By closely examining Apple, we can identify the following trends: The stock's Price to Earnings ratio of 41.48 is lower than the industry average by 0.92x , suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants. It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 66.94 which exceeds the industry average by 10.28x . With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.94 , which is 4.71x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% that is 16.47% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 79.27x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 22.62% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by evaluating its debt relative to its equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By analyzing Apple in relation to its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be derived: When evaluating the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple is in the middle position among its top 4 peers. The company maintains a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , suggesting a relatively balanced financial structure. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The PB and PS ratios are high, suggesting overvaluation relative to industry standards. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit signify strong profitability, while the low revenue growth implies slower expansion compared to industry peers.

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO ) CleanSpark Inc (NASDAQ: CLSK ) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY ) SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES ) Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS ) Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL ) Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT ) Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ ) Why It's Important : Tesla ranked as the most-searched ticker on Benzinga Pro for another month, taking the crown for the month of December. The stock is regularly one of the most-searched tickers on the site each month. Super Micro Computer climbed up the leaderboard for the month, ranking second in December. The surge in interest came with shares down significantly in the month. Nvidia ranked third for the month of December, its lowest ranking in several months of tracking. Several companies made their first appearance on the list of most-searched tickers with the theme of quantum computing stocks showing through in the monthly rankings. Quantum Computing, Rigetti and D-Wave Quantum all ranked among the top 20 searched tickers for the month of December. Other newcomers to the top 10 included SoundHound AI, a popular AI play and short squeeze candidate. The stock has been highlighted several times in the Benzinga Stock Whisper Index and company executives have been interviewed by Benzinga recently. MicroStrategy, who is one of the largest holders of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) ranked ninth in the list, gaining from a 16 th place ranking in September. The stock continues to be a proxy for Bitcoin, but with the rise of Bitcoin ETFs will be an interesting case study to watch in 2025 for investor appetite with more ways for investors to get exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. Nukkleus was another newcomer to the top 10 and will be worth watching to see if this is a one-month inclusion or start of investor momentum. On the ETF front, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ranked fourth for the month and continues to be one of the most-watched ETFs. The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 fell to 20 th for the month after ranking 15 th in October and sixth in September. Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ), which ranked third in October, fell out of the top 20 stocks. This could show that the stock gained momentum around the 2024 election and the move may have been short-lived. With President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration in January, it will be worth monitoring to see if the stock gains in price and interest among Benzinga readers.

The media giant could continue its streak as the highest-grossing film studio with a strong lineup of films. Ranking second on the list is Comcast, which has several potential blockbusters including the return of the Jurassic World franchise and the sequel to ""Wicked."" Comcast had several of the highest-grossing films in 2024, including ""Wicked,"" which ranked third domestically. Warner Bros. and Paramount rank next on the list, but the titles might not be as recognizable to everyone and could signal that 2025 is a year for Disney and Comcast to distance themselves from the field. ""Superman"" will be a major test for Warner Bros. in the rebirth of the plans for the DC Comics film franchise. Outside of the media companies, movie theater stocks such as AMC and Cinemark Holdings (NYSE: CNK ) might be best positioned to benefit from the overall movie slate and projections for the box office revenue to rise in 2025.

2024-12-31 15:00:30,AAPL,"Investigating Apple's Standing In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry Compared To Competitors",BZ$19a658ac,BZ,"In the fast-paced and cutthroat world of business, conducting thorough company analysis is essential for investors and industry experts. In this article, we will undertake a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in comparison to its major competitors within the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing crucial financial metrics, market position, and growth potential, our objective is to provide valuable insights for investors and offer a deeper understanding of company's performance in the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 41.48 66.94 9.94 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.09 1.13 0.95 5.72% $1.44 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.45 26.55 3.81 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 65.52 1.77 1.39 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 160.21 14.45 7.23 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Super Micro Computer Inc 15.27 3.28 1.24 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 9.79 0.56 0.60 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 55.13 3.37 1.02 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 24.08 1 0.61 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 45.32 6.51 2.11 7.36% $0.41 $0.82 22.62% By conducting a comprehensive analysis of Apple, the following trends become evident: A Price to Earnings ratio of 41.48 significantly below the industry average by 0.92x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 66.94 relative to the industry average by 10.28x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. The Price to Sales ratio of 9.94 , which is 4.71x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% that is 16.47% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 79.27x above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly below the industry average of 22.62% . This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a measure that indicates the level of debt a company has taken on relative to the value of its assets net of liabilities. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When assessing Apple against its top 4 peers using the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following comparisons can be made: Apple holds a middle position in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates a balanced financial structure with a moderate level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, but may be facing challenges in revenue expansion.

2024-12-31 13:00:26,AAPL,"Apple, Amazon, Samsung, And Nintendo: What Tech Marvels Are These Giants Cooking In 2025",BZ$19a630f4,BZ,"As we look ahead to 2025, the technology landscape appears poised for transformation with several highly anticipated releases from industry giants. From novel AR experiences to next-generation gaming and computing power, here’s what might shape our digital future. Samsung’s Vision For Everyday AR A leak this year suggested that Samsung Electronic Co’s (OTC: SSNLF ) would leverage its partnerships with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google and Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) to develop AI-powered smart glasses. The device could be potentially similar to Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: META ) collaboration with Ray-Ban . These glasses could feature advanced micro-LED displays, eye-tracking, and gesture controls. Samsung reportedly plans an initial production run of approximately 500,000 units, with a targeted release window in the third quarter of 2025. See Also: Not All iPhone Charging Cables Are Safe: Here’s How Hackers Turned Them Into Tools Of Espionage Nintendo Switch 2: Evolution Of Hybrid Gaming Nintendo ADR’s (OTC: NTDOY ) anticipated Switch successor looks to build upon the foundation of its predecessor. The reported 8-inch display reportedly offers a more immersive handheld experience, while magnetic Joy-Cons may provide better durability and responsiveness. Moreover, Nintendo’s commitment to backward compatibility could reportedly ensure a smooth transition for its extensive user base. The hybrid nature of the console continues to distinguish Nintendo in the gaming market. Apple M5 MacBook Pro: Pushing Performance Boundaries Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) silicon journey continues with the rumored M5 chip, potentially marking another leap forward in mobile computing. While maintaining the proven design language of current MacBooks, the M5 processor could introduce architectural improvements that further separate Apple from traditional x86-based competitors. Expected improvements in machine learning capabilities and power efficiency might enable new workflows previously impractical on portable devices. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Amazon's Finally Upgraded Alexa Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) reportedly plans to overhaul its Alexa smart assistant in 2025, integrating generative AI for smarter, more intuitive voice commands. The upgraded voice assistant, revealed in September 2023, was slated for release this year. It promises ChatGPT -like intelligence and more fluid, conversational exchanges. However, a November report stated, ""Alexa AI teams were recently told that their target deadline had been moved into 2025."" Apple iPad (11th Gen): Speed Boost Incoming Apple is likely to launch the 11th generation of its iconic iPad in 2025. The new device will reportedly maintain a design similar to the 2022 version while offering a significant speed boost. It’s rumored to feature either the A16 chip from the iPhone 15 or possibly an upgrade to the A17 or A18. This new iPad promises improved performance and efficiency, building on its predecessors. With these exciting gadgets, 2025 is shaping up to be a year of major technological breakthroughs.

2024-12-31 07:40:41,AAPL,"!Jensen Huang's Nvidia 'Printing Money Like Apple' In Early iPhone Days, Says Tesla Bull Ross Gerber",BZ$19a5bdc1,BZ,"Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is on the cusp of a significant growth phase, fueled by its leadership in AI infrastructure. What Happened : Investor Ross Gerber compared Jensen Huang ‘s chip giant current financial trajectory to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) during the early iPhone years, highlighting the immense potential in AI, Yahoo Finance reported on Tuesday. “Nvidia is printing money like Apple did in the early days of the iPhone,” he said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Gerber, a decade-long investor in Nvidia and Tesla , sees the company’s growth driven by the global development of AI infrastructure, largely supported by Nvidia’s cutting-edge chips. He mentioned that Nvidia’s profitability and strong market position in the chip industry make the upcoming five years promising. Gerber also compared Nvidia to Tesla, adding the former has been a better investment in the past decade. This year, Nvidia has drawn $30 billion in retail investor inflows, ranking as the most favored stock among retail investors in 2024. Despite some traders recently offloading shares, Nvidia’s stock has surged 181% year to date. Nvidia’s founder and CEO, Jensen Huang , is set to speak at CES 2025, potentially further boosting the stock. See Also: Kiyosaki Warns Of Bitcoin In Black Rocks ETF: ‘It Is Suppressing Bitcoin Price’ Why It Matters : Nvidia’s strategic focus on robotics as a new growth driver comes amid fierce competition in the AI chipmaking sector, particularly from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. . Nvidia’s valuation surpassed $3 trillion , rivaling Apple Inc. , fueled by the AI boom. The company has also invested in humanoid robotics firms like Figure AI, marking its entry into ‘physical AI.’ Additionally, Ibiden Co. , a key supplier for Nvidia , is considering expanding its production capacity to meet the surging demand for AI chip package substrates. This move underscores the robust demand for AI-use substrates, with all available stock being quickly acquired by customers. Ibiden’s new substrate factory in Gifu, Japan, is expected to begin operations at 25% capacity by late 2025, eventually reaching 50% by March 2026.

2024-12-31 06:57:25,AAPL,MagSafe Won't Be Phased Out By EU's New Directive: Here's Why MacBook Users Have Nothing To Worry About,BZ$19a5b03f,BZ,"The EU’s USB-C directive has officially come into force, mandating a universal charging port for electronic devices. What Happened: The directive, effective from 2025, requires mobile phones to feature a USB-C port. All 27 EU member states had until Dec. 28 to incorporate this directive into their national laws. The regulation covers a wide range of devices, including mobiles, tablets, digital cameras, and portable speakers, among others. See Also: Apple’s AI-Driven Growth, AirTag 2, AirPods’ Health Features, And iPhone 17 Pro: This Week In Appleverse Laptop manufacturers have until April 28, 2026, to comply. However, certain high-power devices, like the Sony Group Corp's (NYSE: SONY ) PlayStation 5 , are exempt. Additionally, the directive stipulates that devices capable of charging with higher voltages or currents must support USB Power Delivery (USB-PD). This affects brands like OnePlus and Oppo . The European Commission also permits the sale of new devices without chargers to minimize waste. A graphic on retail boxes will indicate if a charger is included, helping consumers adapt to the new regulations. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. It's time for THE charger. Today, the USB-C becomes officially the common standard for charging electronic devices in the EU. It means better-charging technology, reduced e-waste, and less fuss to find the chargers you need. #DigitalEU — European Commission (@EU_Commission) December 28, 2024 Why It Matters: The directive also allows devices to retain proprietary charging solutions alongside USB-C ports. This means that the current MacBook lineup with MagSafe complies, as it supports charging through both Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) magnetic connector and the EU-approved technology. While many companies voluntarily embraced USB-C, the legislation applied enough pressure to compel holdouts like Apple to finally incorporate USB-C into their devices. Despite being a key contributor to the development of the USB-C port, Apple was slow to adopt it for its iPhones. The company is now facing challenges in markets like India , where similar regulations are being considered.

2024-12-31 06:48:14,AAPL,iPhone 17 To Get Display Upgrade As Apple Finally Ditches 60Hz Technology? New Leak Reiterates Possibility,BZ$19a5af09,BZ,"A new leak reiterates that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is reportedly set to improve the display technology in its upcoming iPhone 17 series. What Happened: Over the weekend, Weibo-based Chinese leaker Digital Chat Station said that supply chain materials support the rumors of a higher refresh rate for the standard iPhone 17. Although the exact refresh rate wasn’t specified, earlier reports suggest a 120Hz ProMotion rate, which was previously exclusive to Pro models, might be implemented. See Also: OpenAI’s For-Profit Transition, Trump’s AI Advisor, And Google’s Code Red: This Week In AI Source: Weibo ProMotion technology, enabled by low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels, allows for variable refresh rates from 1Hz to 120Hz. This technology enhances user experience with smoother scrolling and video playback, and always-on functionality for time, widgets, and notifications on Lock Screens. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: Earlier, Ross Young from Display Supply Chain Consultants indicated that both the standard iPhone 17 and a new model, tentatively named “iPhone 17 Air,” will feature ProMotion displays. This shift means all four iPhone models in 2025 will have ProMotion, eliminating the 60Hz displays that have been standard in previous base models. Meanwhile, Novatek’s OLED technology could play a crucial role in the design of the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air . Leaks regarding iPhone 17 Pro Max suggest that the device could feature 12GB DRAM and upgraded cooling systems. These enhancements, along with improved on-device AI capabilities, are likely to be major selling points for the iPhone 17 Pro Max.

2024-12-30 22:02:01,AAPL,"Dow Jones 2024 Scoreboard: Top 5 Winners, Losers &#x2014; And How Amazon, Nvidia Could Reshape 2025 (CORRECTED)",BZ$19a3f300,BZ,"Editor’s Note: This article was updated to correct the rankings to account for Walmart’s 2024 stock split. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high of over 45,000 points in December, one of several stock market indexes to hit records after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. Here's a look at the top-performing and worst-performing Dow Jones Industrial Average components in 2024 and how the index's leaders could look much different in 2025. 2024 Performance : In 2024, 18 of the Dow Jones component stocks were up, with 12 stocks declining for the full year. This includes the original Dow Jones members at the start of 2024 and does not factor in the index changes made throughout the year. Here's a look at the top five gainers for the full year, based on Dec. 27 closing prices: Walmart (NYSE: WMT ): +70.6% American Express (NYSE: AXP ): +60.7% Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ): +49.4% JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ): +41.8% International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ): +36.2% Here are the top five losers for the full year, based on Dec. 27 closing prices: Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDSSQ:WBA): -63.2% Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ): -59.6% Boeing Inc (NYSE: BA ): -30.7% Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ): -29.6% Dow Inc (NYSE: DOW ) -27.0% For comparison, 19 of the Dow Jones components stocks were up in 2023 , with 11 down for the full year. A quick look at the losers list shows two stocks that are no longer part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, thanks to several changes that took place in 2024 to the 30 core components. Apple is the only stock to appear on the top gainers list for both 2023 and 2024, ranking fourth in 2023 and fifth in 2024. Intel was the second-biggest gainer in 2023 before falling in 2024 and turning in the second-worst performance of the 30 stocks. Boeing also flipped from being a top performer, ranking fifth in 2023 to turning in a poor performance in 2024. Walgreens was the worst-performing Dow Jones stock for the second straight year, but that will be a thing of the past heading into 2025. Read Also: Nvidia Joining Dow Jones Industrial Average: Where Tech Giant Ranks In The Index, Why Sherwin-Williams Addition Could Be More Important What's Next in 2025: After several years of no changes to the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the well-known market index made multiple changes in 2024. The index replaced underperforming Walgreens with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ) in February. The index also replaced Intel and Dow Inc with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW ) respectively. With the changes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average will now have four of the seven Magnificent 7 stocks heading into 2025 with Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) all included in the Dow. The stocks that left the Dow Jones in 2024 were among the biggest losers in 2024 for the index, with Walgreens ranking worst for yearly performance, Intel ranking second worst and Dow ranking sixth worst at -27.0%. The underperformance of several Dow Jones components kept the index down compared to other market barometers. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE: DIA ), which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is up 14.0% year-to-date in 2024. For comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ), which tracks the S&P 500 Index, is up 23.8% year-to-date. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS ), which tracks the Magnificent 7 stocks, is up 68.5% year-to-date. Having Amazon, Nvidia and Sherwin Williams as components to start 2024 would have made the index's returns look significantly different. While the three stocks that left the index were each down over 25% year-to-date in 2024, here are the year-to-date returns of the replacement stocks in 2024: Amazon: +46.6% Nvidia: +179.8% Sherwin-Williams: +11.8% The Dow Jones Industrial Average will look significantly different in 2025 than in previous years, and more changes could be ahead for stocks that have underperformed in the index.

2024-12-30 15:00:34,AAPL,"Industry Comparison: Evaluating Apple Against Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$19a3877b,BZ,"In the fast-paced and highly competitive business world of today, conducting thorough company analysis is essential for investors and industry observers. In this article, we will conduct an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in relation to its major competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. Through a detailed examination of key financial metrics, market standing, and growth prospects, our objective is to provide valuable insights and illuminate company's performance in the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 42.04 67.84 10.07 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.22 1.15 0.96 5.72% $1.44 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.54 26.66 3.82 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 66.70 1.80 1.42 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 163.21 14.72 7.37 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Super Micro Computer Inc 15.92 3.42 1.29 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 10.01 0.57 0.61 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 54.58 3.34 1.01 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 24.24 1.01 0.61 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 45.93 6.58 2.14 7.36% $0.41 $0.82 22.62% When conducting a detailed analysis of Apple, the following trends become clear: The stock's Price to Earnings ratio of 42.04 is lower than the industry average by 0.92x , suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants. It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 67.84 which exceeds the industry average by 10.31x . The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 10.07 , surpassing the industry average by 4.71x , may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance. The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% , which is 16.47% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential. With higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 79.27x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. With a revenue growth of 6.07% , which is much lower than the industry average of 22.62% , the company is experiencing a notable slowdown in sales expansion. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a financial metric that helps determine the level of financial risk associated with a company's capital structure. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By considering the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple can be compared to its top 4 peers, leading to the following observations: Apple is positioned in the middle in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This suggests a balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a moderate level of debt while also relying on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The PB and PS ratios are high, suggesting overvaluation relative to industry standards. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit signify strong profitability, while the low revenue growth may raise concerns about future performance compared to industry peers.

2024-12-30 13:47:03,AAPL,!Apple's Chinese Rival Huawei Slashes Prices For New Year Boost: Should Tim Cook-Led Company Be Worried? Here's What Analysts Are Saying About AAPL Stock,BZ$19a36920,BZ,"Apple Inc 's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) new intelligence features for the iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 updates are expected to boost sales as it enters other geographies in 2025. However, Apple's Chinese competitor Huawei has announced heavy discounts for the New Year on their premium models, challenging the former's sales performance in this key market. What Happened: Apple’s smartphone sales in China dipped 0.3% year-on-year in the third quarter of their current fiscal year. This resulted in just a 15.6% market share for Apple. Meanwhile, their main competitor, Huawei, saw a significant increase of 42% in market share during the same period, capturing 15.3% of the market. According to research by the International Data Corporation, Vivo took the top spot with a market share of 18.6%, up 21.5% year-on-year. As Apple’s sales decline in China, Huawei, their fastest-growing competitor, has capitalized on the opportunity by announcing major discounts as part of JD.com’s ‘Super Brand Day' promotion. According to a post on Huawei’s Weibo account and a Reuters report, the company’s best-selling products will be discounted by up to 3,000 yuan (approximately $411) starting at 8:00 p.m. local time on Saturday and running through midnight on Sunday. The discounts will also apply to Huawei’s smartphones, headphones, watches, and tablets. See Also: Top 7 Blue-Chip Stocks With The Best Return Potential Going Into 2025 Why It Matters: While it’s uncertain whether Huawei’s price cuts will prompt other Chinese smartphone manufacturers to follow suit, and whether Apple can still maintain strong sales performance by the end of the year. Here's what analysts are saying. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has expressed optimism regarding Apple’s future, projecting a 26% potential appreciation in the company’s stock price. Ives attributes this growth projection to a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence. He believes this AI-driven cycle will propel Apple into a period of substantial growth extending into 2025. Raising price target on Apple to $325 as a golden era of growth for Cupertino is now on the horizon into 2025. We believe Apple is heading into a multi-year AI driven iPhone upgrade cycle still being underestimated by the Street. The consumer AI Revolution goes thru 🍎 🔥🐂🍎🍏 — Dan Ives (@DivesTech) December 26, 2024 According to Benzinga , AAPL has a consensus ‘buy’ with a price target of $245.27 per share based on the ratings of 30 analysts. The highest price target out of all the analysts tracked by Benzinga is $325 issued by Wedbush Securities maintaining its ‘outperform' rating on Dec. 26, 2024. Morgan Stanley reiterated its ‘overweight' rating with a target price of $273 apiece on Dec.13 2024 citing that the company’s AI initiative, is expected to significantly boost iPhone replacement cycles in fiscal 2025, potentially driving a surge in demand despite current subdued iPhone sales."" The lowest target price of $184 per share, maintaining a ‘underweight’ from Barclays was adjusted on Nov. 1, 2024. Barclays tempered its forecast due to factors like delayed ChatGPT integration in the iPhone 16, staggered international launches, and muted initial enthusiasm. Concerns around China’s market, regulatory hurdles for Apple Services, and the evolving AI strategy also contributed. The imminent release of Huawei’s 5G phone adds to the competitive pressure Apple faces, according to Barclays. The average price target of $286 between Wedbush, Morgan Stanley, and Needham implies a 12.38% upside for the Tim Cook -led company. Price Action: Shares were down 0.41% in premarket to $254.61 apiece, whereas the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ) declined by 0.25% at $521.19. On a year-to-date basis, Apple gained 37.71% this year whereas QQQ advanced by 29.78%.

2024-12-30 13:41:18,AAPL,!Nvidia Targets Robotics as Next Big Opportunity Amid Rising AI Rivalry,BZ$19a36775,BZ,"Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is eying robotics as its next growth catalyst as it battles intense rivalry in its artificial intelligence chipmaking business from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: AMD ). Also, core Big Tech giants, including Amazon.Com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), are competing in a space that aims to reduce their dependence on the chip designer by producing their own inbuilt chips. Nvidia’s valuation breached the $3 trillion mark, rubbing shoulders with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ), backed by the AI frenzy. It has become a ‘physical AI’ investor by backing humanoid robotics companies like Figure AI. Also Read: Elon Musk Reveals Toughest Part Of Building Tesla’s Humanoid Robot: ‘Improving The Design Of Optimus For Ease Of Manufacturing Robotics company Apptronik, a Nvidia client, also tapped Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google DeepMind , underscoring the growing interest in robotics. Nvidia will showcase its advanced technology compact computers for humanoid robots known as Jetson Thor in the first half of 2025 . Nvidia’s vice president of robotics told the Financial Times that “the ChatGPT moment for physical AI and robotics is around the corner,” adding that the market has reached a “tipping point.” Talla told the FT that the outburst of generative AI models and the ability to train robots leveraging simulated environments drove the robotics market shift. During Nvidia’s annual conference in March , CEO Jensen Huang voiced allegiance to the robotics sector, revealing robots powered by Nvidia’s chips. Unlike how Google supplies Android for smartphones, Nvidia intends to provide the underlying technology instead of building robots. The global robotics market is worth $78 billion with the potential to reach $165 billion by 2029, FT cites the BCC. Nvidia stock surged 185% year-to-date. Citi’s Atif Malik expects Nvidia’s profit margin to bottom out in the April 2025 quarter, with an upward trend expected thereafter as it addresses AI robotics demand in warehouses, manufacturing, and humanoid robot sectors. Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore flagged AI PCs, autonomous vehicles, software, and robotics as potential revenue drivers for Nvidia. Investors can gain exposure to Nvidia through JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ ) and Vanguard Total World Stock Index ETF (NYSE: VT ). Price Action: NVDA stock is down 1.01% at $135.63 premarket at the last check Monday.

(NASDAQ: NVDA ) has proven to be a more lucrative investment than Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) over the past decade, according to Ross Gerber , CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management , who recommends treating the chipmaker as a core portfolio holding alongside tech giants. What Happened : “Nvidia has been a better investment than Tesla over the last 10+ years,” Gerber told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview. “For investors, Nvidia needs to be a part of your portfolio just as much as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ).” The statement comes as Nvidia has captured unprecedented attention from retail investors in 2024, attracting nearly $30 billion in individual investor inflows through mid-December, according to CNBC. This surpasses the investment in broad market funds like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) by almost twofold. Nvidia’s stock has soared more than 180% year-to-date, surpassing Tesla’s 73% increase during the same period.

Gerber Kawasaki manages over $2.1 billion in assets, according to its latest 13F filing. The recommendation also aligns with broader market sentiment , as retail investors have increasingly favored Nvidia over previous retail favorite Tesla. Despite recent market volatility, Vanda Research notes that Nvidia maintains a growing presence in average investment portfolios. The company’s strength in AI chips has been further bolstered by recent U.S. policy developments, including a President Joe Biden administration’s investigation into China’s semiconductor industry that could benefit American chip producers.

2024-12-29 12:00:18,AAPL,"Apple's AI-Driven Growth, AirTag 2, AirPods' Health Features, And iPhone 17 Pro: This Week In Appleverse",BZ$19a21fa6,BZ,"The holiday week was abuzz with news from Apple Inc.

Let’s dive into the top stories from the weekend. Tech Bull Foresees 26% Upside for Apple Stock Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is optimistic about Apple’s future, predicting a 26% upside for the company’s stock. Ives attributes this potential growth to a “multi-year” upgrade cycle for the iPhone, driven by artificial intelligence (AI). He believes this will usher in a “golden era of growth for Cupertino” into 2025. Read the full article here. Apple’s AirTag 2: Enhanced Tracking and Safety Apple is reportedly gearing up to launch the AirTag 2, with significant upgrades in range and safety.

Analysts at JPMorgan are optimistic about Cupertino’s prospects, giving the Apple stock an overweight rating and a price target of $265. Read the full article here.

2024-12-28 03:42:47,AAPL,"Apple Halts iPhone 14, iPhone SE Sales In EU: Here's Why",BZ$19a12b0c,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has stopped selling its iPhone 14 , iPhone 14 Plus, and third-generation iPhone SE models across most European Union countries. What Happened : Apple's decision is a response to new EU regulation requiring USB-C ports for smartphones with wired charging capabilities. The affected iPhone models have been removed from Apple’s online store in several countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden. The regulation, effective Dec. 28, applies to any iPhone unit placed for sale after that date, even older models. While the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models comply with the regulation, the iPhone 14 and SE models do not.

Apple began phasing out these models last week, with in-store availability expected to vary as remaining inventory is sold out. A fourth-generation iPhone SE with a USB-C port is anticipated in March, allowing for a quick return to the EU market. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters : The EU’s mandate for USB-C ports has been a long time coming. Back in October 2022, Apple confirmed its compliance with the EU’s directive, which requires a standardized charger for consumer electronic devices starting in 2024. Apple’s senior vice president, Greg Joswiak , acknowledged the necessity to adhere to these regulations . In September 2023, Apple unveiled the iPhone 15 series, featuring the much-anticipated USB-C port , during its ""Wonderlust"" event. This move marked a significant shift for Apple, which had been a major contributor to the development of the USB-C port alongside industry giants like Intel. Moreover, the EU’s regulatory focus on Apple extends beyond hardware . In September, the European Commission initiated proceedings to ensure Apple’s compliance with interoperability obligations under the Digital Markets Act. This includes granting greater access to third-party developers and businesses. Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link .

2024-12-27 19:49:34,AAPL,Apple Teases Streaming 'See For Yourself' Event: Could This Be A Free Preview Of AppleTV+ Or Ad-Supported Platform?,BZ$19a04906,BZ,"Technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) could have an exciting 2025 ahead, a year that could include something new for its AppleTV+ streaming platform. What Happened: Apple is teasing that something special will happen for AppleTV+ on Jan. 4 through Jan. 5 with a tweet that says ""stay tuned"" with an image that says ""see for yourself."" The dates listed – Jan 4 and 5 – happen to be a Saturday and Sunday, prompting rumors that Apple could be offering a free weekend preview of its content to non-subscribers. Benzinga reached out to Apple for comment. A report from Macrumors says speculation is that Apple will offer a free weekend preview of its content, but the post could also mean that it will just be showcasing a look at its upcoming TV shows and movies on those dates. The report noted that Apple has never offered a free all-you-can-watch weekend event, which could show the importance of what the announcement truly means. AppleTV+ is $9.99 per month for up to six members with a free seven-day trial for new subscribers. Apple also offers a free three-month trial for people who buy new Apple devices. The free trial often limits what content can be watched by non-subscribers. Another possibility regarding the Apple post could be connected to a rumor earlier this year that the company could be launching an ad-supported version of its streaming platform, following the lead of Netflix and Disney. Apple previously had a $4.99 monthly subscription price. At $9.99 per month, AppleTV+ is one of the cheaper ad-free plans and the company could use the January dates highlighted to launch the new ad-supported plan. Read Also: Apple’s $1B Gamble On 3 Blockbusters: Box Office Results, Streaming Impact, And Oscar Nominations Why It's Important: Launched in 2019, AppleTV+ has a smaller library of movies and shows than larger streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+. Apple is investing in growth for the platform with several blockbuster movies getting theatrical releases and then exclusively playing on AppleTV+. It is also investing in media rights for sports like Major League Baseball games and the exclusive rights to Major League Soccer. Top shows on the platform include ""Shrinking,"" ""Silo,"" ""Slow Horses,"" ""Severance,"" ""Ted Lasso"" and ""Bad Sisters,"" according to Apple . A highly anticipated second season of ""Severance"" is set to premiere on Jan. 17 making the Jan. 4 and 5 dates an important event ahead of one of its top show's new seasons. ""Wolfs,"" which starred George Clooney and Brad Pitt , became the most watched movie in AppleTV+ history recently. The movie saw a limited theatrical release, which may have left money on the table, while providing a boost to streaming viewership figures and potentially an uptick in subscribers. Apple traditionally premieres its films in theaters first, helping to recover some of its costs while ensuring the movies are eligible for award shows that require a theatrical run. In contrast, Netflix often premieres its movies on the streaming platform and rarely shows its movies in theaters. Apple finds itself in a difficult place with the need to spend more on content to boost subscribers, but also having less to spend on movies and content due to a smaller subscriber base. With the parent company a cash cow, Apple may be able to maintain losses for its streaming business if it chooses to, but could also push for a larger focus on profits. AAPL Price Action: Apple stock is down 2% to $253.38 on Friday versus a 52-week trading range of $164.08 to $260.09. Apple stock is up 37% year-to-date in 2024.

2024-12-27 15:00:27,AAPL,"Assessing Apple's Performance Against Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$199fe6e5,BZ,"In today's rapidly evolving and fiercely competitive business landscape, it is crucial for investors and industry analysts to conduct comprehensive company evaluations. In this article, we will undertake an in-depth industry comparison, assessing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) alongside its primary competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By meticulously examining crucial financial indicators, market positioning, and growth potential, we aim to provide valuable insights to investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 42.60 68.75 10.21 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.41 1.17 0.98 5.72% $1.44 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.80 26.97 3.87 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Pure Storage Inc 167.69 15.13 7.57 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Western Digital Corp 67.81 1.83 1.44 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 16.79 3.61 1.36 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 10.41 0.60 0.64 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 54.45 3.33 1 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 25.59 1.07 0.65 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 46.99 6.71 2.19 7.36% $0.41 $0.82 22.62% By conducting a comprehensive analysis of Apple, the following trends become evident: At 42.6 , the stock's Price to Earnings ratio is 0.91x less than the industry average, suggesting favorable growth potential. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 68.75 relative to the industry average by 10.25x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. The Price to Sales ratio of 10.21 , which is 4.66x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% that is 16.47% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 79.27x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 22.62% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a measure that indicates the level of debt a company has taken on relative to the value of its assets net of liabilities. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. In terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple can be assessed by comparing it to its top 4 peers, resulting in the following observations: In the context of the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple holds a middle position among its top 4 peers. This indicates a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , which implies a relatively balanced financial structure with a reasonable debt-equity mix. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is performing well financially but may face challenges in revenue expansion. Overall, Apple's strong profitability metrics outweigh the lower revenue growth, positioning it favorably within the industry sector.

2024-12-27 12:48:04,AAPL,"!US Stocks Likely Headed For 10% Correction, Says Top Strategist, Points Out 'Horrible Market Breadth:' Trump's Tariff Plans, Musk Co-Led DOGE Could Be Partially To Blame For Decline",BZ$199fb5bd,BZ,"U.S. equity markets could be headed for a correction due to a confluence of factors like the growing divergence from ""Magnificent 7"" stocks and President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans, according to market expert Jay Woods . What Happened: In an interview with CNBC , Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, cautioned about the possibility of a market correction in the near term. According to Woods, we could be at the beginning of a 10% correction in the equity markets. Woods noted that these corrections happen roughly once every 18 months. ""We've had a tremendous run, 10% correction is due to happen every 18 months… What we're seeing is just horrible market breadth,"" Woods said. Woods added that while the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks — Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) — have done well, the divergence in their performance and that of the overall market is ""getting a little bit too rich"" for him. See Also: Cathie Wood Takes Profit On Hot AI Stock Palantir Again, Continues To Sell Block Shares Amid Bitcoin Buzz ""Once we get to the new quarter, we're going to have some headwinds to deal with. We may see some of those Mag 7 names give back a little bit. I don't think the rotation will keep us from having a 10% correction."" ""It's not going to be fun,"" he quipped. Woods also pointed to uncertainty due to Trump's tariff plans as a possible headwind that could have an impact on the markets. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy-led Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) plans to cut down federal spending could also result in an uptick in unemployment, said Woods. Why It Matters : The potential for a market correction has been echoed by other financial experts. Brian Arcese from Foord Asset Management has also raised concerns about the slowing U.S. economic growth and corporate earnings, which could trigger a correction if they continue to decelerate. Arcese pointed out that the S&P 500 has been “expensive for quite a while,” with a price-to-earnings ratio exceeding 27. Additionally, Jeremy Siegel , professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, described a recent stock market downturn as a “healthy” reaction to the Federal Reserve’s cautious approach to future interest rate cuts. The Fed’s decision to lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point led to declines across major Wall Street indexes, as investors had anticipated more aggressive rate reductions. Billionaire investor David Einhorn characterized the market as “really, really, really pricey,” noting that the Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio is at one of the highest levels in a century. Despite these high valuations, Einhorn clarified that this does not make him bearish, as asset prices can remain mispriced for extended periods. Price Action: According to Benzinga Pro , as of Friday’s pre-market session, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ), which mirrors the S&P 500, has gained 1.68% over the past five days. Similarly, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ ), which tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, has risen by 1.65% during the same period.

All four index futures slipped in trade.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) co-founder Steve Jobs is credited for his visionary leadership and for revolutionizing entire product categories, ranging from smartphones to tablets and music. Jobs knew what a MacBook should look like in 1983. While it took the company 25 years to realize Jobs’ vision, Apple stock is now soaring to record highs. Optimistic Analysts: Analysts at JPMorgan are upbeat about Cupertino's prospects, giving the Apple stock an overweight rating and a price target of $265, implying an upside of over 2%. ""We see upside in several aspects of the business as well as financials that remain underappreciated by investors, namely the transformation of the company to Services, growth in the installed base, technology leadership, and optionality around capital deployment,"" said JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee to CNBC. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Over the past month, Apple stock has gained over 10%, while year-to-date, it is up by over 39%, according to Benzinga Pro data . What Jobs Said In 1983: Jobs, well known for not just his leadership but also some great speeches, outlined his vision for a notebook. ""Apple strategy is really simple. What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you that you can learn how to use in 20 minutes."" ""We don't know how to do that. It's impossible technically. So we had three options. One was to do nothing. The second one was to put a piece of garbage computer in a book. And we can do that, but our competitors are doing that, so we don't need to do that,"" said Jobs. ""The third option was to design the computer that we want to put into the book eventually, even though we can't put into the book now. And right now it fits into a bread box and it's $10,000 and it's called Lisa."" While Lisa was Jobs' dreamchild, MacBook is what he was ultimately aiming for. ""The next thing we will do is we will find a way put it in a shoebox and sell it for like $2,500 and that will be the next step. And finally we'll find a way to get it in a book and sell it for under $1,000."" Bullish Analysts: The overall analyst sentiment is bullish on the AAPL stock – Benzinga Pro data shows 30 analysts have a consensus buy rating. Based on the average price target of $286 between Wedbush , Morgan Stanley , and Needham , there’s an implied 10.51% upside for AAPL stock.

2024-12-27 02:11:14,AAPL,Palantir Touted As 'Next Oracle' By Dan Ives: Here Is Why The Wedbush Analyst Called The Company A 'Table Pounder',BZ$199eac1f,BZ,"Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR ) could emerge as “the next Oracle” in the artificial intelligence revolution, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives , who dubbed the data analytics firm “the Messi of AI” despite its stock already surging 395.42% in 2024. What Happened : The company’s stock, trading at $82.14, has become the S&P 500’s top performer this year, pushing its market capitalization to $183.23 billion. This remarkable run has positioned Palantir well above Wedbush’s $75 price target, though Ives maintains strong conviction in the company’s growth trajectory. “Looking ahead to the next 5-10 years, I believe it’s all about Palantir. In the context of the AI revolution, this is just the beginning,” Ives emphasized on CNBC’s Closing Bell Overtime. He describes Palantir as a “table-pounder” stock that investors should consider adding to their portfolios, despite its current price-to-earnings ratio of 411.90. Former Palantir employee Alex Fishman , now with Empros Capital , provided additional insight into the company’s potential: “When I look at Palantir, it’s one of the few companies where I can easily envision it becoming 10 or 20 times its current size.” Fishman highlighted Palantir’s crucial role in defense and commercial sectors, describing it as “the glue that ties everything together” in coordinating critical technological efforts. See Also: Billionaire Investors Michael Burry, David Tepper Could Benefit From China’s Stimulus Measures Why It Matters : Wall Street’s broader consensus remains more conservative, with an average price target of $35.58 based on 20 analyst ratings. However, recent updates suggest growing optimism. UBS issued an $80 price target on December 19, while Mizuho and Baird released positive outlooks, though their average target of $64.67 still implies a potential downside. The company’s technical indicators suggest room for continued growth, with an RSI reading of 62 indicating the stock isn’t yet in overbought territory despite its dramatic rise. The stock’s 52-week range of $15.66 to $84.80 reflects its volatile but upward trajectory. In the same discussion, Ives also raised Apple Inc. ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) price target to $325, citing AI initiatives, though he emphasized Palantir’s unique position in the enterprise AI space. As companies increasingly adopt AI solutions, Ives believes Palantir’s commercial expansion and defense sector dominance position it for continued growth into 2025.

By examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem.

This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 68.53 relative to the industry average by 10.21x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 10.17 , which is 4.67x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance. The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% , which is 16.47% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential. Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 79.27x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 22.62% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio indicates the proportion of debt and equity used by a company to finance its assets and operations. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When evaluating Apple alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise: In terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple is positioned in the middle among its top 4 peers. This suggests a relatively balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a moderate level of debt while also utilizing equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is performing well financially but may be facing challenges in revenue expansion within the industry sector.

2024-12-26 13:26:34,AAPL,"Your Smart Watch Band Might Contain Toxic, Cancer-Linked 'Forever Chemicals,' Study Reveals",BZ$199d2633,BZ,"Concerns are rising over the safety of smartwatch bands after a new study identified the presence of hazardous chemicals in these popular accessories. What Happened : A recent study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters has discovered that smart watch bands may contain harmful substances. These bands, often made from synthetic rubber known as fluoroelastomers, can include perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), a type of “forever chemical,” Salon reported on Thursday, PFHxA is part of a group of industrial compounds called per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are resistant to degradation. These chemicals have been associated with serious health issues, including cancer and infertility. Despite the risks, PFAS are commonly found in various consumer products such as non-stick cookware and water-resistant fabrics. The study, led by Graham F. Peaslee from the University of Notre Dame, analyzed 22 watch bands from different brands and price ranges. Surprisingly, PFHxA was the most frequently detected compound. Peaslee noted that the public might not recognize fluoroelastomers as a type of PFAS, leading to unintentional exposure. See Also: iPhone 17 Pro To Retain Iconic ‘Triangular’ Camera Layout Despite Rumors Of Radical Horizontal Layout Although the study did not involve human testing, the researchers warned that high PFAS levels in these bands could lead to significant skin absorption, especially during activities involving sweat and open pores. Why It Matters : The revelation of toxic chemicals in smart watch bands comes at a time when the global wrist-worn device market is experiencing significant growth. Chinese tech giants are challenging the dominance of established players like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The global market saw shipments reach 139 million units in the first three quarters of 2024, with China leading the charge. Additionally, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF ) is intensifying its competition with Apple by launching new wearables, including the Galaxy Ring and Watch Ultra. As the market expands, the potential health risks associated with PFAS in smart watch bands could become a significant concern for consumers and manufacturers alike.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) could ride the artificial intelligence boom, with its crown jewel iPhone expected to witness a ""multi-year"" upgrade cycle, according to an analyst. What Happened: Tech bull and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that Apple's iPhone sales could witness a boost thanks to AI. ""Raising price target on Apple to $325 as a golden era of growth for Cupertino is now on the horizon into 2025,"" said Ives in a post on X. Apple stock closed at $258.20 on Tuesday, up 1.2% for the day. Year-to-date, Apple shares have gained 39%, according to Benzinga Pro data . Ives’ $325 price target implies a 26% upside.

Ltd. , the Cupertino-based company unveiled the Apple Intelligence suite of AI features with the iPhone 16 series in September. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.

Why It Matters: The recent price target hike aligns with Ives' previous predictions , which foresees Apple reaching a $4 trillion market capitalization by early 2025. This projection is driven by strong iPhone sales and AI innovations. Recent supply chain checks in Asia indicate robust iPhone 16 upgrade trends, particularly during the holiday season. Ives believes that the success of the iPhone 16 will serve as a launchpad for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino over the next 12 to 18 months. Furthermore, Ives predicts that Apple will ship a record 240 million iPhones in 2025, setting a new annual record as AI features in the iPhone 16 spark a “multi-year supercycle.” This projection underscores the significance of AI integration in consumer devices, with Apple Inc. leading the charge.

In this article, we will conduct an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in relation to its major competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. Through a detailed examination of key financial metrics, market standing, and growth prospects, our objective is to provide valuable insights and illuminate company's performance in the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem.

It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 67.75 which exceeds the industry average by 10.25x . With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 10.06 , which is 4.7x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% that is 16.47% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 67.71x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. With a revenue growth of 6.07% , which is much lower than the industry average of 22.62% , the company is experiencing a notable slowdown in sales expansion. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio gauges the extent to which a company has financed its operations through debt relative to equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By evaluating Apple against its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following observations arise: Apple holds a middle position in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates a balanced financial structure with a moderate level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, despite slower revenue growth.

2024-12-25 10:20:00,AAPL,"What To Expect From Apple's AirTag 2: Ultra Wideband Boost, Enhanced Tracking, Safety Upgrades And More",BZ$199bd4f3,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is gearing up to launch the AirTag 2 , featuring significant upgrades in range and safety. Everything we know so far about Apple's upcoming item tracker: Ultra Wideband Chip For Longer Range One of the most anticipated upgrades for the AirTag 2 is the integration of Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip. This new chip, first seen in the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 , significantly boosts the tracker's range —potentially up to three times the distance of the first-generation AirTag. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Improved Safety Measures To Address Stalking Concerns One rumored change involves the tracker's built-in speaker, which is expected to be more difficult to remove. This tweak could help address concerns about AirTags being used for unauthorized tracking or stalking. See Also: Elon Musk A Legendary Entrepreneur But Also A Bully, Says OpenAI CEO Sam Altman: ‘Now It’s Me, It’s Been Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Lots Of Other People’ Better Integration With Apple Vision Pro While specific details remain scarce, rumors suggest that the AirTag 2 will feature better compatibility with Apple Vision Pro , the company's mixed-reality headset. This integration could unlock new possibilities for spatial tracking. Design Consistency Overhaul Unlikely Unlike some of Apple's other product updates, the AirTag 2 is not expected to undergo a major design overhaul. The current circular and compact form factor has proven effective, and Apple seems to be focusing on internal upgrades rather than aesthetic changes for its second-generation tracker. Why It Matters: According to verified market research, the AirTag keychain market, valued at $0.6 billion in 2023, is anticipated to surge to $4.2 billion by 2030. This reflects a compound annual growth rate of 35.19% from 2024 to 2030. In January 2023, it was reported that Apple had sold over $1 billion worth of AirTags —approximately 55 million units—since its debut in April 2021. Earlier this year, Apple was also hit with a lawsuit claiming that AirTags were being used by stalkers for malicious purposes . However, AirTags have also demonstrated their value in numerous scenarios, including helping to recover stolen possessions. Last month, Cupertino also launched a new feature enabling users to share the location of lost items with third parties, like airlines, via the Find My app. Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link .

2024-12-25 04:08:35,AAPL,Google Can No Longer 'Adequately Represent' Apple's Interests &#x2014; iPhone-Maker Seeks To Defend $20 Billion Search Deal In Landmark Antitrust Case,BZ$199b72ac,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) intends to participate in the upcoming U.S. antitrust trial involving Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google . What Happened: The move comes as Apple seeks to defend its billion-dollar revenue-sharing agreements with Google, a significant source of income for the tech giant, reported Reuters. According to court documents filed in Washington on Monday, Apple has no plans to develop its own search engine to compete with Google, irrespective of the continuation of the payments. Apple said, “Google can no longer adequately represent Apple's interests: Google must now defend against a broad effort to break up its business units.” See Also: Want $500 In Google Store Credit? Here’s What You Need To Do Apple is preparing to present witnesses at the trial, which is set for April. The prosecution’s goal is to prove that Google needs to take several measures , including selling its Chrome web browser and possibly its Android operating system, to reestablish competition in the online search market. In 2022 alone, Apple’s agreement with Google brought in an estimated $20 billion . Alphabet did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments. Why It Matters: On Dec. 20, Google responded to the proposed remedies in its search distribution case with the DOJ, focusing on non-exclusivity and increased flexibility to limit regulatory overreach. Last year, Apple’s Eddy Cue justified the billion-dollar deal with Google , citing it as the best available option despite lamenting Google’s privacy policies. Price Action: On Tuesday, Alphabet's Class A shares gained 0.76%, closing at $196.11, while Class C shares advanced 0.81%, ending at $197.57, as per Benzinga Pro data . Apple shares climbed 1.15% during regular trading hours, closing at $258.20, but dipped 0.039% in after-hours trading.

2024-12-24 18:38:39,AAPL,!Broadcom and Netflix Clash Over Patent Disputes Ahead of 2025 Trial,BZ$199ac636,BZ,"On Monday, Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) prosecuted Broadcom Inc. ‘s (NASDAQ: AVGO ) cloud computing subsidiary VMware in a California court for allegedly infringing its patent rights. Netflix accused VMware of violating five patent rights in “virtual machines” that run another computer’s operating software on a host computer, according to the Reuters report. Broadcom’s U.S. lawsuit against Netflix will likely go to trial in June 2025. Netflix sought monetary damages. Broadcom held $9.35 billion in cash and equivalents as of November 3, 2024 . Also Read: Elon Musk’s xAI To Expand With New Chatbot App This is not the first case between the two companies – Broadcom filed a patent dispute case against Netflix in 2018 for alleged infringement of Broadcom patents related to video streaming technology. In 2023, Broadcom snapped VMware for $69 billion. Analyst opinions on Broadcom and Netflix: In September 2024, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur lauded the VMware acquisition for impressive synergies , with a 25%+ sequential growth expectation in the fourth quarter. VMware helped infrastructure software revenue grow 41% in the third quarter, helping Broadcom’s revenue climb to $13.07 billion, topping consensus estimates. Sur flagged VMware’s strong software renewal rates and upsell opportunities, with revenue potentially reaching $4.5-$5 billion per quarter by 2025. Rosenblatt , B of A Securities , and JP Morgan raised their price targets on Broadcom after its fourth-quarter report, citing its custom-chip (ASIC) AI and ability to maintain a relationship with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein hailed Netflix as the sole investable mainstream media stock , citing its streaming moat and potential for live event upside. Price Actions: NFLX stock closed up 2.27% at $932.12 on Tuesday. AVGO up by 3.15%.

2024-12-24 15:00:29,AAPL,"Insights Into Apple's Performance Versus Peers In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Sector",BZ$199a3919,BZ,"In today's fast-paced and competitive business landscape, it is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts to thoroughly analyze companies before making investment decisions. In this article, we will conduct a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) against its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 41.99 67.75 10.06 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.31 1.16 0.97 5.72% $2.02 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.75 26.91 3.86 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 67.65 1.83 1.44 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 163.59 14.76 7.39 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Super Micro Computer Inc 16.13 3.47 1.31 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 9.73 0.56 0.59 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 51.48 3.15 0.95 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 25.49 1.06 0.64 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 45.89 6.61 2.14 7.36% $0.48 $0.82 22.62% Through a detailed examination of Apple, we can deduce the following trends: The Price to Earnings ratio of 41.99 is 0.92x lower than the industry average, indicating potential undervaluation for the stock. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 67.75 relative to the industry average by 10.25x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. The Price to Sales ratio of 10.06 , which is 4.7x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.47% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 67.71x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 22.62% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio indicates the proportion of debt and equity used by a company to finance its assets and operations. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By considering the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple can be compared to its top 4 peers, leading to the following observations: As Apple is in the middle of the list in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, it suggests that the company has a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 compared to the other companies. This position indicates a relatively balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a reasonable level of debt while also leveraging equity for financing its operations. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, but may be facing challenges in revenue expansion.

2024-12-24 13:56:42,AAPL,!How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,BZ$199a26e2,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares settled slightly higher during Monday's session . Apple is on track to become the first company to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization by ""early 2025,"" driven by strong iPhone sales and artificial intelligence innovations, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. The tech giant's shares have surged nearly 40% since January, closing at $255 per share on Monday with a market cap of $3.86 trillion. This performance puts Apple ahead of rivals NVIDIA Corp . (NASDAQ: NVDA ) at $3.35 trillion and Microsoft Corp . (NASDAQ: MSFT ) at $3.22 trillion. With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. Currently, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.39%, a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,531,620 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $306,324 or around 1,200 shares . To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.3% to close at $255.27 on Monday.

2024-12-24 12:34:25,AAPL,"Warren Buffett Heads Into 2025 With $325 Billion Cash Pile, His Largest in Over Three Decades: Expert Says It 'Will Provide An Opportunity For The Successors To Make Their Own Mark'",BZ$199a156a,BZ,"Warren Buffett is entering 2025 with the largest cash reserve at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ) in over three decades. What Happened : The conglomerate’s cash holdings have reached a staggering $325 billion, marking the highest percentage of total assets since 1990, CNBC reported on Tuesday. This cash accumulation comes as Buffett, 94, finds few attractive investment opportunities amid a highly valued market. The “Buffett indicator,” which compares the total market value of U.S. stocks to GDP, has soared to 209%, a level not seen since the 1929 market peak, according to Oppenheimer data. Throughout 2024, Buffett sold significant portions of his largest holdings, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC ), offloading $133 billion in stocks during the year’s first three quarters. Despite this, Berkshire’s shares rose 27% in 2024, its best performance since 2021. See Also: Smith & Wesson’s Fate Hangs In The Balance As Supreme Court Weighs Mexico’s Gun Trafficking Lawsuit: SWBI Stock Down 27% Over Past Month, Here’s What’s Next Buffett’s strategy may involve waiting for a major acquisition opportunity, potentially benefiting his successor, Greg Abel . Analyst Kevin Heal from Argus Research suggests that some of the cash could be used for investments in distressed situations, allowing successors to leave their mark. ""This will also provide an opportunity for the successors to make their own mark when Mr. Buffett ocially hands over the reins."" Why It Matters : This substantial cash reserve positions Berkshire Hathaway for strategic maneuvers in the coming years. Recently, Buffett’s investment activities have shown a shift.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is reportedly preparing to enter the smart doorbell market with its upcoming device featuring Face ID. The device is expected to give Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) established Ring offerings a tough challenge. Users undoubtedly have many questions, and we’re here to address them with an early comparison: Feature Apple Doorbell (Upcoming) Amazon Ring (Current Models) Facial Recognition Yes, powered by Face ID No, relies on motion detection and recording Privacy Focus Strong emphasis on user privacy Previous concerns about law enforcement access Storage Options Likely iCloud-based Cloud (subscription) and local options User Notifications Alerts on Apple devices (iPhone, Apple Watch) Alerts via Alexa devices and app See Also: Amazon Analysts See Growth Ahead With AWS In ‘Early Innings Of A Big AI Cycle,’ Advertising Segment Fast-Growing ‘Hidden Asset’ Privacy: A Key Differentiator Apple's focus on privacy could set its doorbell apart. The device is expected to safeguard user data by restricting access and ensuring video footage is securely stored on iCloud. Apple's reputation for prioritizing user privacy may attract consumers concerned about surveillance risks. Amazon's Ring has faced criticism over its data-sharing practices. Reports of police accessing Ring footage without user consent have raised alarms among privacy advocates. However, in January, Amazon stated that Ring will no longer permit police departments to request footage from users’ doorbell cameras.

Revenue: In 2018, Amazon acquired Ring for an estimated $1 billion. When Will It Launch: Apple’s doorbell is still in the early stages, with no expectation of a market release before the end of next year at the earliest, according to the Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman. The Global Smart Home Market was valued at $75.36 billion in 2020 and is expected to exceed $423.95 billion by 2028, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 24.10% from 2022 to 2028, according to Vantage market research.

2024-12-24 08:57:54,AAPL,Warren Buffett Once Called Berkshire The 'Opposite Of Those Who Hurry To Sell' &#x2014; Now He's Offloading Apple And Snapping Up Occidental Petroleum Amid A 20% Drop,BZ$1999d436,BZ,"Warren Buffett ‘s Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ) has significantly increased its stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY ) through five purchases last week, seemingly diverging from the legendary investor’s long-held investment principles regarding declining stocks. What Happened : Regulatory filings show Berkshire acquired approximately 8.9 million shares of Occidental between Dec. 17 and Dec. 19, investing about $405 million at an average price of $46 per share. The purchases have increased Berkshire’s ownership to 264.2 million shares, representing a 28% stake worth approximately $12 billion. The move appears to contrast with Buffett’s own investment philosophy, outlined in his 1988 letter to Berkshire shareholders. Quoting then-Fidelity Magellan fund manager Peter Lynch , Buffett wrote, “We are just the opposite of those who hurry to sell and book profits when companies perform well but who tenaciously hang on to businesses that disappoint.” He likened such behavior to “cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.” Buffett’s recent decision to reduce his stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has sparked speculation, with Berkshire Hathaway gaining $97 billion in cash, raising its cash reserves to a record $325 billion. While some analysts suggest the sale was driven by Apple’s high price-to-earnings ratio, others believe Buffett may be preparing for a leadership transition or anticipating a crisis . The recent purchases are notable as they were made at prices significantly below Berkshire’s previous average cost basis of $54.20 per share. Occidental’s stock has declined 20.33% this year, with shares trading consistently below $50 in recent weeks. The increased investment comes amid challenging market conditions for energy companies. The International Energy Agency recently reduced its forecast for oil demand growth through 2024 and 2025, citing weakening demand from China and increasing supplies from the Americas. Crude Oil WTI prices have declined approximately 35.36% since its peak of $112 in June 2022 in the last 5 years. See Also: Tesla Shorts, Gordon Johnson, And James Chanos Express Skepticism On Robotaxi Potential Amid Usage Data Debate Why It Matters : Occidental’s financial performance reflects these industry headwinds. The company’s free cash flow has decreased significantly in recent quarters, dropping to $275 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $548 million in the second quarter, marking the lowest levels since early 2021. However, it rebounded strongly in the third quarter, surging to over $2 billion. The company’s next earnings announcement is scheduled for Feb. 20. The oil producer currently maintains a dividend yield of 1.84%, notably lower than its historical range of 3.5% to 5% over the past decade. According to company investor presentations , maintaining a sustainable and growing dividend remains a key priority for Occidental’s management. Berkshire’s continued investment in Occidental represents one of Buffett’s largest recent positions, even as the company faces industry-wide challenges and stock price pressure. The trades have sparked a modest market reaction, with Occidental shares rising from $45.30 to $47.90 following the disclosure of Berkshire’s purchases, according to data from Benzinga Pro . Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Occidental, with a consensus price target of $62.86 from 23 analysts. Raymond James set the highest target at $78, while Piper Sandler’s lowest is $51. Recent ratings from Piper Sandler, Mizuho, and UBS average $57.33, indicating a potential 19.52% upside.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is on track to become the first company to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization by “early 2025,” driven by strong iPhone sales and artificial intelligence innovations, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives . What Happened : The tech giant’s shares have surged nearly 40% since January, closing at $255 per share on Monday with a market cap of $3.86 trillion. This performance puts Apple ahead of rivals NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) at $3.35 trillion and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) at $3.22 trillion. Recent supply chain checks in Asia indicate robust iPhone 16 upgrade trends heading into the Christmas season. “We believe the success of iPhone 16 with a strong holiday season ahead over the next week will be the launchpad for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives wrote in a weekend report, according to New York Post.

Apple reported iPhone sales of $46.22 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, marking a 6% year-over-year increase and reversing two consecutive quarters of decline. Despite its strong position, Apple faces industry challenges. The company’s revenue growth of 6.07% lags behind the technology hardware sector average of 21.95%, according to Benzinga data . However, Apple maintains superior profitability metrics, with its EBITDA of $32.5 billion significantly exceeding industry averages. The stock’s current price-to-earnings ratio of 40.8 suggests potential undervaluation compared to industry peers, even as the company strengthens its AI capabilities through partnerships, including a recent collaboration with NVIDIA to enhance large language model performance .

2024-12-23 20:32:22,AAPL,!Meta Plans Display-Equipped Ray-Ban Glasses By 2025: FT,BZ$1998725a,BZ,"Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ: META ), the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, aims to advance wearable technology by integrating displays into its Ray-Ban smart glasses by 2025, the Financial Times reports. The $300 sunglasses, developed with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica (OTC: ESLOF ) (OTC: ESLOY ), could feature small screens to display notifications and responses from Meta’s virtual assistant, the Financial Times cites familiar sources. This development aims to position Meta as a frontrunner in augmented reality (AR) and wearable computing, which has the potential to replace smartphones as key computing devices. Also Read: Meta Cuts Jobs in WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs In Latest Reorganization According to the report, the next iteration of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, expected in late 2025, will introduce display technology, marking a step toward CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of lightweight AR headsets. The move aligns with Meta’s broader strategy to integrate advanced technologies into everyday wearables, competing with companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Meta is also fast-tracking the development of its prototype AR glasses, Orion, after receiving positive feedback from early testers. The glasses feature advanced silicon carbide lenses for brighter and larger imagery. Last week, Meta launched three new features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses, including live AI, live translations, and Shazam . Meta’s smart glasses have emerged as a blockbuster product in 60% of Ray-Ban stores in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa . Despite lacking AI features in Europe, the glasses outperformed conventional Ray-Ban models. In mid-December, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth flagged 2025 as the most significant year in the history of the Reality Labs unit behind the company’s glasses and headsets. According to reports, the current model features sensitive in-ear speakers, cameras, and microphones. Wall Street firms, including JMP Securities, Wedbush, Oppenheimer, and Guggenheim, hailed Meta’s launch of a VR headset and AI updates after the Connect event in September. They expect Meta’s AI and VR innovations to be pivotal in helping it reach valuations like Apple’s. Meta stock surged 71% year-to-date. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through Vanguard Large-Cap ETF (NYSE: VV ) and Vanguard Communication Services ETF (NYSE: VOX ).

2024-12-23 20:00:21,AAPL,A Look Into Apple Inc's Price Over Earnings,BZ$19986d90,BZ,"In the current market session, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock price is at $254.02, after a 0.18% drop. However, over the past month, the company's stock spiked by 8.07% , and in the past year, by 31.58% . Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Apple P/E Compared to Competitors The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued. Apple has a better P/E ratio of 41.86 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 34.77 of the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. Ideally, one might believe that Apple Inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued. In summary, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a valuable tool for investors to evaluate a company's market performance, it should be used with caution. A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes. Copyright © Benzinga.

2024-12-23 15:00:30,AAPL,"Performance Comparison: Apple And Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$1997352e,BZ,"In the dynamic and fiercely competitive business environment, conducting a thorough analysis of companies is crucial for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will perform an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in relation to its major competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By closely examining crucial financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to offer valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 41.86 67.55 10.03 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.20 1.15 0.96 5.72% $2.02 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.82 27 3.87 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Pure Storage Inc 165.13 14.89 7.45 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Western Digital Corp 66.22 1.79 1.40 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 15.72 3.38 1.27 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 9.79 0.56 0.60 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 51.52 3.15 0.95 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 25.65 1.07 0.65 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 45.88 6.62 2.14 7.36% $0.48 $0.82 22.62% By analyzing Apple, we can infer the following trends: The stock's Price to Earnings ratio of 41.86 is lower than the industry average by 0.91x , suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 67.55 relative to the industry average by 10.2x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 10.03 , surpassing the industry average by 4.69x , may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance. The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% , which is 16.47% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential. The company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 67.71x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 6.07% compared to the industry average of 22.62% , which indicates a challenging sales environment. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a financial metric that helps determine the level of financial risk associated with a company's capital structure. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By analyzing Apple in relation to its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be derived: Apple falls in the middle of the list when considering the debt-to-equity ratio. This indicates that the company has a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , suggesting a balanced financial structure with a reasonable debt-equitymix. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales highly. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability compared to industry peers. However, the low revenue growth may indicate challenges in expanding market share. This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor. Copyright © Benzinga.

2024-12-23 13:29:21,AAPL,"!Alphabet Defends DOJ Case, 'New Buyback' Likely From This '2025 Top Pick'",BZ$19970e0f,BZ,"Google -parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) has laid out its remedies proposal in the high-stakes search distribution case with the Department of Justice (DOJ). JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth notes that Google's focus on non-exclusivity and increased flexibility aligns with its strategy to limit regulatory overreach. However, investors should also turn their attention to Google's operational strength, which could be a significant driver of long-term value. Alphabet’s Remedies In DOJ Case Google's proposal, filed on Dec. 20, sidesteps the harsher measures suggested by the DOJ, such as divestiture of Chrome or Android. Instead, the company's remedies focus on removing search exclusivity in browser and Android agreements and giving partners greater flexibility. This should allow partners like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and mobile carriers to preload multiple search engines. This shift could create opportunities for competitors, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ), to vie for top spots. Anmuth expects the judge's final decision in August 2025 to strike a balance between the DOJ and Google's proposals, likely considering user impacts. Still, the timing of remedy enforcement, appeals and potential injunctions adds uncertainty to financial implications.

Anmuth emphasizes that Alphabet is demonstrating ""tremendous innovation in AI,"" which continues to bolster healthy Search and overall ad revenue growth. The company's ability to ""durably re-engineer the cost base and expand margins"" further strengthens its financial position. Moreover, Alphabet “will likely announce a new buyback authorization at 1Q earnings,” signaling confidence in future cash flows, says Anmuth. Alphabet Among JPMorgan’s 2025 Top Picks JPMorgan sees Alphabet as “one of our 2025 Top Picks”, alongside Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ), and Spotify Technology SA (NYSE: SPOT ). Anmuth projects a December 2025 price target of $232, supported by Alphabet's strong 30%+ operating income margin and double-digit percentage revenue growth. Beyond ads, Alphabet's non-ad businesses like Cloud and YouTube subscriptions hold significant growth potential. Meanwhile, ventures like Waymo and Verily offer optionality for future value. The Road Ahead For Alphabet Stock Investors Investor focus is shifting toward how a new administration could influence final remedies due in March 2025. A potential settlement or adjustments in Apple's search agreements could also sway outcomes. The court case may cast a shadow though Alphabet's core strengths are intact. Despite the regulatory noise, Alphabet stock remains a compelling play for investors seeking exposure to a leader in AI and digital transformation. Read Next: Quantum Computing: The New AI?

2024-12-23 13:17:28,AAPL,!Elon Musk's xAI To Expand With New Chatbot App,BZ$19970a78,BZ,"Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI , is testing a standalone Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS app for its chatbot, Grok. Grok was now available only to users of Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter Inc ). The app can access real-time data from the web and X and offers generative AI features like rewriting text and generating images from text prompts . Also Read: Broadcom Expects Decade-Long AI Chip Boom as Big Tech Invest Billions xAI is also preparing a site, Grok.com, to make the chatbot accessible on the web, TechCrunch reports . Grok was previously available only to X’s paying subscribers. In November, the company started testing a free chatbot version and rolled it out to all users earlier this month. The company’s chatbot image generator model allows users to create images using pictures of public figures and copyrighted material. xAI has reportedly reached a $50 billion valuation just 16 months after its July 2023 founding, surpassing the billionaire’s spending on acquiring Twitter. OpenAI , one of the most recognized names in artificial intelligence, took over nine years to reach its current valuation of $157 billion. Reportedly, xAI is rapidly gaining momentum in the competitive AI market, now valued higher than rivals like Anthropic, worth $19 billion, and Perplexity, valued at $2.8 billion. xAI achieved significant milestones by securing $5 billion in its latest funding round to acquire 100,000 Nvidia chips. These chips will drive the Memphis supercomputer, a facility built to advance the company’s AI capabilities and bolster Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.

2024-12-23 04:18:11,AAPL,"Apple AirPods To Get Heart Rate, Temperature Sensors, And Cameras To Help With AI Features: Top Analyst",BZ$199614f3,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is taking its AirPods to the next level with plans to introduce heart rate monitors, temperature sensors, and even cameras to boost AI capabilities. What Happened: In his “Power On” newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman reported that Apple's teams are currently experimenting with new improvements. This includes heart rate monitoring, temperature sensing, and advanced sensors to track various physiological measures. The primary focus is to incorporate heart rate monitoring, a feature already available on the Apple Watch , into the AirPods. It could debut with the next-generation AirPods Pro. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Cupertino is also working on integrating cameras into the AirPods to facilitate AI services. The technology could take a couple more years to hit the market, provided it doesn't get canceled once again, said Gurman. Why It Matters: In September, Apple announced a new suite of features for the AirPods Pro 2 , including active Hearing Protection, a scientifically validated Hearing Test, and a clinical-grade Hearing Aid. These advancements are awaiting approval from health authorities like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are expected to launch this fall in over 100 markets. Apple’s wearables segment continues to be a significant revenue driver, with AirPods playing a key role. In the fiscal fourth quarter , the wearables division generated $9.04 billion, though Apple's share in the true wireless stereo market has declined from 48.1% in 2019 to 17% today. Price Action: Apple’s stock rose by 1.88% on Friday, ending the day at $254.49. Year-to-date, shares have increased by 37.09%, based on data from Benzinga Pro . The latest analyst reports from Morgan Stanley, Needham, and Wedbush have set an average price target of $277.67, indicating a potential upside of 8.74%.

2024-12-22 18:15:24,AAPL,!Apple Developing Face ID Smart Doorbell To Unlock Doors By Late 2025,BZ$1995d0fa,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is reportedly developing a smart doorbell camera with Face ID technology that could unlock doors using facial recognition. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in his “Power On” newsletter, the innovative device may be released by the end of 2025 ""at the soonest."" The smart lock system would function similarly to an iPhone, unlocking doors when a registered user or resident is recognized by the camera. Apple plans to integrate its Secure Enclave chip, which securely stores and processes Face ID data separately from other hardware, ensuring high security. In his post , Gurman suggests that the device will likely work with third-party HomeKit-enabled smart locks. Apple may also partner with a smart lock manufacturer to deliver a complete system at launch. Additionally, the doorbell camera is expected to utilize Apple's in-house ""Proxima"" chip, a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combination set to feature in upcoming HomePod Mini and Apple TV models next year. Also Read: Could Apple Set Revolutionize Tablet Market With 18.8-Inch Foldable iPad? “Also next year, Apple will roll out upgrades to existing home devices: its TV set-top box and HomePod mini smart speaker. That will add an advanced wireless chip dubbed Proxima and better support the new Thread standard for wirelessly linking products in the home,” Gurman wrote in the post. This doorbell camera is part of Apple's broader push into smart home technology under its Apple Intelligence initiative. Rumored products include new smart home cameras, an Apple-branded TV, and smart displays. These displays are said to include an iPad-like device that attaches magnetically to wall mounts or speaker bases and another equipped with a robotic arm for enhanced flexibility. Apple's continued expansion into smart home solutions signals its commitment to creating a cohesive ecosystem of devices designed to enhance daily life with seamless integration and advanced security.

2024-12-20 20:16:21,AAPL,!Which Magnificent 7 Stock Will Do Best In Santa Claus Rally? Tesla Edged Out As 28% Select&#x2026;,BZ$1993af41,BZ,"Benzinga readers pick which Magnificent 7 stock could have the best performance if there is a Santa Claus rally to close 2024 and kickstart 2025. What Happened: The majority of the Magnificent 7 stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date in 2024. With a limited number of trading days left to close out the year, one last question on the mind of investors is whether there will be a Santa Claus rally. The term “Santa Claus rally” was first used by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Stock Trader's Almanac. The term is associated with the last five trading days of a year and the first two days of the following year. Check This Out: Santa Claus Rally In 2024? Poll Shows Investors Split On End Of Year Returns, 57% Say This… Combine the Santa Claus rally potential and the Magnificent 7 outperformance in 2024, and you have the latest Benzinga poll. ""Which Magnificent 7 stock will do the best if there's a Santa Rally?"" Benzinga asked. The results were: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ): 28% Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ): 25% Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ): 17% Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ): 9% Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ): 9% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ): 7% Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ): 5% Nvidia was the winner of the poll with more than one-fourth of the vote, which comes as the stock is the top performer among the Mag 7 stocks for year-to-date and five-year gains. Trailing Nvidia was Tesla, with exactly one-fourth of the vote. Amazon also received a double-digit percentage ranking third at 17%. The other Mag 7 stocks had much smaller percentages in the poll.

Benzinga Poll Finds Over 50% Say… Why It's Important: The expectation for a Santa Claus Rally comes with major stock market indexes enjoying a strong 2024 and could add to their year-to-date gains. Here are the current year-to-date returns of three of the largest market index ETFs. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ): +23.8% Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ ): +28.1% SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE: DIA ): +12.7% For comparison, here are the year-to-date returns of the Magnificent 7 stocks: Nvidia: +177.8% Tesla: +77.4% Meta Platforms: +72.9% Amazon: +49.8% Alphabet: +38.3% Apple: +35.8% Microsoft: +18.7% Nvidia has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and other major indexes and also the other Magnificent 7 stocks. The Benzinga poll shows that readers think Nvidia could go out on a high note in 2024 and kick 2025 off with a bang if there is a Santa Claus rally. Only Microsoft trails the S&P 500 and Invesco QQQ Trust year-to-date returns in 2024, showing the strength of the Magnificent 7 stocks this year. A recent Benzinga poll asked if any Magnificent 7 stocks could beat Nvidia for stock returns in 2025. The results were: None – Nvidia will dominate: 48% Tesla: 27% Amazon: 8% Meta: 7% Alphabet: 6% Microsoft: 3% Apple: 2% The poll found the near-majority predicting Nvidia will have the strongest growth in 2025 and dominate the Magnificent 7 stocks once again. Based on the recent polls, Benzinga readers don't expect the gains for Nvidia to stop anytime soon and a Santa Claus rally could accelerate the company's potential 2025 gains.

Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 41.08 66.30 9.84 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 10.82 1.11 0.93 5.72% $1.23 $2.44 9.7% NetApp Inc 21.47 26.57 3.81 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 65.52 1.77 1.39 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 159.85 14.42 7.22 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Super Micro Computer Inc 15.55 3.34 1.26 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 9.83 0.56 0.60 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 52.13 3.19 0.96 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 25.49 1.06 0.64 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 45.08 6.5 2.1 7.36% $0.38 $0.8 21.95% By closely examining Apple, we can identify the following trends: At 41.08 , the stock's Price to Earnings ratio is 0.91x less than the industry average, suggesting favorable growth potential. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 66.3 relative to the industry average by 10.2x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.84 , which is 4.69x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% that is 16.47% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 85.53x above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 54.85x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. With a revenue growth of 6.07% , which is much lower than the industry average of 21.95% , the company is experiencing a notable slowdown in sales expansion. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by evaluating its debt relative to its equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. In terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple can be assessed by comparing it to its top 4 peers, resulting in the following observations: Apple is positioned in the middle in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This suggests a balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a moderate level of debt while also relying on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, despite slower revenue growth. Overall, Apple's financial performance is solid, with room for potential growth in the future. This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.

Reportedly, OpenAI and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) also tapped Broadcom to develop their AI server chips to diversify their exposure to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Broadcom stock has surged over 101% year-to-date. Also Read: Match Group Analyst Flags Tinder Woes, Industry Challenges For Stock Downgrade Tan told FT that he expected the demand to continue for at least ten years, citing their enormous return potential. Tan stressed to the FT that clients were intensely ramping up AI infrastructure investment plans spanning three to five years. He does not expect the phenomenon to lose steam until his clients run out of finances. Last week, Tan told investors Broadcom could generate tens of billions of dollars in additional annual revenue from AI chips by 2027. Tan’s experience and dealmaking prowess fuelled speculation of rescuing struggling chipmaker Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC ). However, Tan claimed no hostile offers since 2018, when it was tracking Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM ), which succumbed to regulatory opposition. Tan backed his thesis by citing investments by OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI in data centers in 2024. Tan told the FT that its customers will build clusters of up to 1 million AI chips by 2027. However, Tan said that even 1 million chips may not suffice the AI ambitions of OpenAI and Anthropic. Broadcom’s stock price rallied 24% in a single day last Friday after its AI revenues had surged by 220% in fiscal 2024. The chipmaker added over $200 billion to its market cap, breaching the $1 trillion milestone for the first time. Rosenblatt’s Hans Mosesmann expects Broadcom’s growing moat in expanding custom-chip (ASIC) AI and surging AI opportunities to intensify the rivalry with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Nvidia.

This marks the second time that Disney hit the $2 billion figure since 2019, with the most recent milestone achieved in 2022, as reported by Deadline . Since 2010, Disney has reached $2 billion domestically seven times. Disney will add to its year total with the release of ""Mufasa"" in theaters this weekend. Here is a look at the top-grossing movies domestically in 2024 and the public company behind the respective studio.

The top 10 list was led by Disney, Comcast, and Warner Bros., three companies that took home top scores in Variety's movie studios’ year-end grad es. Disney earned an A rating, following a challenging 2023 in which the company failed to produce a $1 billion global grosser for the first time since 2014, excluding the pandemic years. The media giant has seen two films surpass the $1 billion mark globally this year and could add a third with “Moana 2,” which is projected to reach the milestone in December or January. Comcast's Universal brand received an A- score thanks to the hits in the top 10 list and ""The Wild Robot,"" which grossed over $300 million worldwide. ""Universal pulled off the seemingly impossible: Making musicals seem cool to moviegoers,"" Variety writes of the success of ""Wicked."" Variety hands Warner Bros. a B+ rating with several hits among the top 10 grossing films, but a couple of films that underperformed including ""Joker: Folie a Deux"" at $206 million worldwide, calling it a ""costly flop.""

In this article, we will undertake an in-depth industry comparison, assessing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) alongside its primary competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By meticulously examining crucial financial indicators, market positioning, and growth potential, we aim to provide valuable insights to investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem.

This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth. With a Price to Book ratio of 65.84 , which is 10.01x the industry average, Apple might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers. The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.77 , surpassing the industry average by 4.61x , may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.47% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion is 85.53x above the industry average, highlighting stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 54.85x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly below the industry average of 21.95% . This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a financial metric that helps determine the level of financial risk associated with a company's capital structure. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When evaluating Apple alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise: Apple falls in the middle of the list when considering the debt-to-equity ratio. This indicates that the company has a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , suggesting a balanced financial structure with a reasonable debt-equitymix. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales highly. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability, while the low revenue growth may indicate a need for expansion strategies to align with industry trends.

While tech leaders like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) boast strong fundamentals, Chan said their valuations are ""stretched."" Apple, Tesla: Stretched Valuations But Long-Term Potential Apple and Tesla, often regarded as bellwethers for tech innovation, are facing increasing scrutiny from investors. Chan noted their dominant positions in their respective markets but emphasized the risks tied to their lofty valuations. Apple's recent focus on AI and augmented reality has garnered attention, but investors may need to weigh its ability to expand its hardware and software ecosystem sustainably, he told Benzinga. Meanwhile, Tesla's rapid scale in electric vehicles is undeniable, but competition from legacy automakers and new entrants has intensified. Chan underscores a critical point for both giants: ""A correction is not a question of if but when."" Despite this, he advises against completely exiting the tech sector, citing potential tax implications and the challenges of timing reentry. Strategic Insights For those eyeing diversification, Chan recommends the Kurv Technology Titans Select ETF (NASDAQ: KQQQ ), which he says ""balances momentum weighting during bull cycles with income generation during downturns."" This strategy could mitigate risks while maintaining exposure to tech leaders like Apple and Tesla. Beyond The Giants Cloud computing remains a strong growth segment, with giants like Amazon.com Inc.

What Happened: According to an IDC report released on Wednesday, the global wrist-worn device market, including smartwatches and wristbands, saw shipments reach 139 million units in the first three quarters of 2024. Despite a 1% decline due to market saturation in key regions like the U.S. and India, China emerged as a leader with 45.8 million units shipped, marking a 20.1% year-on-year increase. Huawei Technologies led the global market with 23.6 million units shipped, capturing a 16.9% market share. The brand’s GT5 series and Watch D2 were particularly popular. Apple followed with 22.5 million shipments, holding a 16.2% market share. The tech giant experienced a 12.8% decline from the last year due to intense competition.

Previously it was also reported that China is making intense efforts toward achieving technological self-reliance as a direct reaction to U.S. limitations on semiconductor exports to the country. The country is also making waves in the field of AI.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is reportedly engaging in discussions with Tencent (OTC: TCEHY ) and TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance , to integrate their AI models into iPhones sold in China. What Happened: The U.S. tech giant began incorporating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its devices earlier this month. However, due to regulatory constraints in China, Apple is seeking local partners to enhance AI features on its devices. The discussions with Tencent and ByteDance are reportedly in preliminary stages, sources indicated, Reuters reported on Thursday. Apple’s move comes as it faces declining market share in China, the world’s largest smartphone market. The absence of AI capabilities in its latest iPhones has been a significant drawback, especially with increasing competition from domestic brands like Huawei. Apple, Tencent and ByteDance have yet to respond to Benzinga’s queries. See Also: Ahead Of Trump’s Return To White House, US Approves $406M Grant For Taiwan’s Chipmaker GlobalWafers Why It Matters : The potential collaboration with Tencent and ByteDance is critical for Apple as it navigates the competitive Chinese market. In recent months, Apple has faced challenges in China, including a crackdown on app store fees . In August, Apple intensified efforts to compel Tencent and ByteDance to close loopholes that allowed in-app creators to bypass Apple’s 30% commission. Moreover, Apple’s AI ambitions have been met with skepticism. In October, an analyst suggested that Apple’s much-anticipated AI system, Apple Intelligence, might not meet high expectations. This underscores the importance of Apple’s current talks with Chinese tech giants to bolster its AI capabilities. In November, Tim Cook expressed optimism about Apple’s performance in China, highlighting positive signs despite economic challenges. However, he refrained from commenting on the potential impact of economic stimulus. This context emphasizes the strategic importance of Apple’s AI integration efforts in maintaining its market position in China.

2024-12-19 07:10:32,AAPL,"Apple Slams Meta's Interoperability Demands, Cites Privacy Risks &#x2014; Instagram Parent Fires Back: Cupertino's Assertions Have 'No Basis In Reality'",BZ$198e48d6,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has slammed Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) for its numerous requests to access iPhone-maker’s software tools, citing potential privacy and security risks. What Happened: Under the EU’s Digital Markets Act, Apple is required to allow competitors and app developers to inter-operate with its services or face significant fines. Meta has so far submitted 15 interoperability requests, more than any other company, seeking extensive access to Apple’s technology stack, reported Reuters, citing a report in which Cupertino complained about it. The Tim Cook -led tech giant has expressed concerns that Meta’s requests could compromise user privacy and security. See Also: Apple’s 2025 Bull Case: Can It Deliver Without Riding The AI Wave? The company also suggested that the requests are unrelated to the use of Meta’s external devices like smart glasses and VR headsets. Apple cited Meta's history of receiving fines in Europe as a reason for its concern. In response, a Meta spokesperson accused Apple of using privacy as a pretext for anticompetitive behavior. “Every time Apple is called out for its anticompetitive behavior, they defend themselves on privacy grounds that have no basis in reality.” Apple and Meta did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: Since 2014, Cook and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg have clashed over privacy, business models, and product strategies. From Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal to Apple's iOS privacy updates and competing VR headsets, their battle epitomizes the growing tensions between Silicon Valley’s biggest players. This year in February, Apple launched its first-generation mixed-reality headset called Vision Pro , and Zuckerberg wasted no time in sharing his thoughts on the device. “I don't think that Quest is the better value, I think [Meta’s] Quest is the better product, period,” he stated at the time. In June, Apple reportedly declined Meta’s proposal to integrate its AI chatbot, Llama , into the iPhone, citing privacy policy concerns. This report came just days after Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI . In July, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg criticized Apple’s approach, describing it as “soul-crushing” and accusing the company of trying to limit Meta’s technological advancements. Price Action: On Wednesday, Meta’s stock finished 3.59% lower at $597.19, while Apple saw a decline of 2.14%, ending at $248.05, according to Benzinga Pro .

2024-12-19 03:21:30,AAPL,"Nvidia, Apple Team Up To Supercharge ChatGPT-Like LLMs With ReDrafter Technique",BZ$198dd911,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) have announced a collaboration for the improvement in the performance of large language models. What Happened: The partnership focuses on integrating Apple’s Recurrent Drafter (ReDrafter) technique with Nvidia’s TensorRT-LLM, to boost text generation speeds. ReDrafter, which Apple open-sourced earlier this year, combines beam search and dynamic tree attention to improve LLM performance. The collaboration with Nvidia has led to the integration of ReDrafter into TensorRT-LLM, a tool designed to accelerate LLMs on Nvidia GPUs. See Also: Elon Musk Agrees With Satya Nadella As Microsoft CEO Reflects On ‘Incredible Speed’ Of AI Diffusion In 2024 This integration involved adding new operators to improve TensorRT-LLM’s ability to handle complex models and decoding methods. Benchmarking results show a 2.7x increase in token generation speed for greedy decoding on Nvidia GPUs, significantly reducing latency and power consumption. Apple’s machine learning researchers noted that this advancement could lower computational costs and improve user experience by reducing latency in production applications. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: In October earlier this year, Apple reported fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $94.56 billion. Last month, Nvidia reported third-quarter revenue of $35.1 billion, marking a 94% increase compared to the last year, and exceeding the Street consensus estimate of $33.12 billion, as per Benzinga Pro data . Together these two tech giants are worth about $7 trillion, with Apple being the most valuable company in the world and Nvidia ranking third. Price Action: Apple shares fell 2.14% to $248.05 on Wednesday, and dipped further to $247.19 in after-hours trading. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares gained 2.01% to $131.50 in after-hours trading, recovering from a 1.14% decline to $128.91 during the regular session.

2024-12-18 18:20:08,AAPL,!What's Going On With Broadcom Stock?,BZ$198ce0aa,BZ,"Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO ) shares are trading lower Wednesday, pulling back from a recent surge that saw the stock join the $1 trillion club. Here’s a look at what you need to know . What To Know: Broadcom shares have been on a tear over the past week, gaining nearly 40% since reporting earnings . Broadcom shares soared after the company beat earnings estimates and provided strong guidance for AI-related revenue growth. Broadcom’s fourth-quarter revenue was up 51% year-over-year to $14.05 billion, but came up short of estimates of $14.09 billion, according to Benzinga Pro . Despite the miss on overall revenue, Broadcom reported a 220% increase in AI revenue and guided for significant growth in 2025. Positive commentary surrounding AI on the call also helped drive momentum to the upside. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said on the call with analysts and investors that he expects the total addressable market for the company’s AI chips to be between $60 billion and $90 billion over the next few years. He also announced that the company was working on custom AI chips with large cloud customers, per CNBC. Reports from last week suggested that Broadcom was working with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) on AI chip development . The company is reportedly working on development of an AI server chip’s networking technology. Broadcom shares got a boost from the news. Several analysts have weighed in with positive updates since the company reported fourth-quarter results. Multiple analysts maintained Overweight ratings, while others kept Buy ratings on the name. Newly-issued price targets range from $205 to $255. The weakness in Broadcom shares on Wednesday appears to be due to profit-taking in the wake of Broadcom’s incredible surge above the $1 trillion market cap mark. Broadcom shares hit new all-time highs this week, so the stock is likely to remain volatile as investors try to determine the appropriate value of the stock given the recent string of AI news. It’s worth noting that Broadcom was among the top trending stocks on Reddit’s WallStreetBets on Wednesday, suggesting retail investors are also sizing up the name.

2024-12-18 18:13:44,AAPL,!Consumer Finance Watchdog Cracks Down on Credit Card Sneaky Fees and False Promises,BZ$198cdf9b,BZ,"On Wednesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced significant measures to protect consumers from deceptive credit card practices and help them save money on interest and fees. These efforts include issuing a circular to law enforcement agencies, publishing new research on retail credit cards, and launching a comparison tool to aid consumers in navigating the credit card market . Investors will closely watch credit card companies, including Visa Inc (NYSE: V ), Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA ), American Express Co (NYSE: AXP ), Affirm Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ: AFRM ), Corpay, Inc (NYSE: CPAY ), Global Payments Inc (NYSE: GPN ) and Shift4 Payments, Inc (NYSE: FOUR ). Also Read: Jabil Q1 Earnings: Revenue And EPS Beat, Cloud and Data Center Growth, Raises Annual Outlook According to the CFPB, some credit card issuers may be engaging in illegal practices such as devaluing rewards points or miles, making it difficult for consumers to redeem promised benefits. The agency highlighted that companies could face penalties if they fail to deliver advertised rewards, mislead users with hidden terms, or revoke rewards through unclear policies. The circular aims to deter companies from engaging in bait-and-switch tactics and to encourage fair competition within the credit card industry. As part of its ongoing research, the CFPB discovered that retail credit cards often charge higher interest rates than general-purpose cards. According to the study, more than 90% of retail cards carry a maximum annual percentage rate (APR) above 30%, compared to just 38% for non-retail cards. Retail cards, frequently promoted during peak shopping seasons, also account for a disproportionate share of late fees, highlighting potential consumer risks. The CFPB unveiled its “Explore Credit Cards” tool to address these concerns, designed to provide unbiased information about over 500 credit cards. Unlike traditional comparison sites, this platform enables users to compare cards based on interest rates, fees, and rewards without pay-to-play promotions. Earlier this year, the CFPB revealed that larger credit card issuers charge significantly higher interest rates than smaller banks and credit unions. By making average interest rate data publicly accessible, the CFPB aims to empower consumers to make informed decisions and find the best rates tailored to their needs. The CFPB plans to continue monitoring the credit card market and welcomes voluntary data contributions from additional issuers to enhance its comparison tool further. In October, the CFPB ordered Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS ) to pay $89 million in fines for deceptive practices regarding the Apple Card. In December, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) Wealth Management agreed to pay a $15 million fine after the SEC found the firm failed to prevent financial advisors from using client funds to cover personal credit card bills. The SEC investigation uncovered gaps in supervisory practices between 2015 and 2022, allowing unauthorized Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers to advisors’ accounts.

2024-12-18 15:00:30,AAPL,"Market Analysis: Apple And Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$198c39cd,BZ,"In today's rapidly changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, it is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts to thoroughly analyze companies. In this article, we will conduct a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) against its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 41.69 67.28 9.99 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.16 1.13 0.96 5.72% $1.23 $2.44 9.7% NetApp Inc 22.56 27.92 4 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 71.03 1.92 1.51 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 168.62 15.21 7.61 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Super Micro Computer Inc 16.82 3.62 1.36 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 10.63 0.61 0.65 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 53.87 3.29 0.99 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 26.67 1.11 0.67 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 47.67 6.85 2.22 7.36% $0.38 $0.8 21.95% After a detailed analysis of Apple, the following trends become apparent: The Price to Earnings ratio of 41.69 is 0.87x lower than the industry average, indicating potential undervaluation for the stock. With a Price to Book ratio of 67.28 , which is 9.82x the industry average, Apple might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers. The Price to Sales ratio of 9.99 , which is 4.5x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% , which is 16.47% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential. The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 85.53x above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 54.85x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly below the industry average of 21.95% . This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a measure that indicates the level of debt a company has taken on relative to the value of its assets net of liabilities. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By considering the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple can be compared to its top 4 peers, leading to the following observations: When compared to its top 4 peers, Apple has a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . This implies that the company maintains a balanced financial structure with a reasonable level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales highly. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability, while the low revenue growth may indicate a need for expansion strategies to align with industry trends.

2024-12-18 13:54:51,AAPL,"!Apple's iPhone 16 Stumbles On 'Intelligence' Awareness, But Pro Max Shines Bright: Analyst",BZ$198c18cf,BZ,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may be riding high with a $253.48 stock price , but the iPhone 16 cycle is showing signs of stumbling, according to JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee. The latest Wave7 Research survey paints a mixed picture, with iPhone market share trailing behind the iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 cycles during the critical October to November period. Despite a seasonally better month, the iPhone 16 cycle's market share clocks in at 66%, down from 69% in 2023 and 70% in 2022. The likely culprit? There is a lack of buzz around Apple Intelligence, the tech giant's much-touted new feature. Carrier store reps say consumer awareness is still alarmingly low—67% of reps surveyed reported ""low"" awareness, while just 10% called it ""high."" So much for artificial intelligence leading a real upgrade cycle.

It's clear that Apple's premium strategy is paying off at the top end of the spectrum, even as the 16 Plus struggles with a mere 7% share. The Samsung S24 Ultra outshone Apple's iPhone 16 Pro/Max in photography chops, with its superior range and resolution earning 50% of the votes. Apple trailed with 30%, barely edging out Google's Pixel 9 Pro/XL at 18%. What's Next For Apple? While Apple Intelligence hasn't captured the public imagination yet, Apple's loyal base and robust sales of high-end models suggest the potential for a second wind.

2024-12-18 13:23:12,AAPL,"!Sony Semiconductor Hits 20 Billion Image Sensor Shipments, Plans Expansion",BZ$198c0d98,BZ,"On Wednesday, Sony Group Corp’s (NYSE: SONY ) semiconductor division announced it accomplished a significant milestone by shipping over 20 billion image sensors. Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing accomplished the feat in just five years after reaching 10 billion units in May 2019. In an interview with Nikkei, President Yoshihiro Yamaguchi highlighted Sony’s ambition to lead advancements in the image sensor sector. According to Yamaguchi, Sony shows no signs of slowing its progress. A new manufacturing facility is under construction in Japan’s Kumamoto prefecture, a growing hub for the chip industry. Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing initially entered the market with CCD (charge-coupled device) image sensors in the 1980s before transitioning to CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology. A Verge report indicated Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) transition to using Samsung Electronics (OTC: SSNLF ) camera sensors for its iPhones as early as 2026, potentially ending Sony’s over-decade-long role as the exclusive supplier of iPhone camera sensors. Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said upcoming iPhones could feature Samsung’s “1/2.6-inch 48MP ultra-wide CMOS image sensors.” However, whether Samsung will replace Sony with other camera components remains to be seen. In November, Sony reported fiscal second-quarter 2024 sales growth of 3% to $19.44 billion (2.91 trillion Japanese yen), missing the consensus estimate of $19.62 billion.

2024-12-18 09:53:29,AAPL,"US Stocks Led By Apple, Nvidia, And Other Tech Giants Dominate Nearly Two-Thirds Of MSCI World Index, Drawing Parallels To 1980s Peak",BZ$198ba8be,BZ,"The U.S. has the world’s largest companies by market capitalization and about two-thirds of the MSCI World Index is dominated by companies based out of America. What Happened: U.S.-based companies ranking among the world’s top ten firms by market capitalization include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO ). These magnificent seven firms along with Broadcom are the beneficiaries of the U.S. tech and AI boom. The remaining two non-U.S. firms that make up the top ten include Saudi Arabian Oil Co and Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg Co Ltd (NYSE: TSMC ). According to an X post by Kevin Gordon , director and senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, “Such an imbalance has not been seen since the late 1980s.” The data shared by him shows nine out of the top ten companies by market capitalization were based out of the U.S. in the 1980s. ""…the US, with 4% of the world's population, roughly a quarter of global GDP and a third of global profits, now accounts for more than two-thirds of the MSCI World index's capitalization. Such an imbalance has not been seen since the late 1980s…,” he said.

This index captures 1,397 large and mid-cap companies across 23 developed markets. According to MSCI’s latest release, dated Nov. 29, the U.S. has a weightage of 73.92% in the index, followed by Japan with 5.23%, the United Kingdom with 3.44%, Canada with 3.1% and France with 2.5%. The index has the highest exposure of 25.29% to information technology companies, followed by 16.3% to financial firms.

2024-12-18 04:55:29,AAPL,Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra And S25+ Leaks Feature Sleek Curved Design And Slimmer Bezels Than Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max,BZ$198b041d,BZ,"New leaks have emerged, offering a glimpse into the design of the upcoming Samsung Electronics Co.'s (OTC: SSNLF ) Galaxy S25 Ultra and S25+ . What Happened: Images shared by Evan Blass on a private X , formerly Twitter , account showcase the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s sleek curved corners and notably thin display bezels, reported 9To5Google. The device is depicted running One UI 7 , although further details remain scarce from the images alone. The Galaxy S25 Ultra’s bezels are reportedly thinner than those on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 16 Pro Max . See Also: Micron Gets Investment From White House, China Launches Antitrust Investigation On Nvidia, Apple Faces $1 The Galaxy S25+ images, posted by the handle Jukanlosreve , suggest minimal changes in hardware design compared to its predecessor. Source: X The device features a prominent mmWave window and a slightly modified camera module, maintaining a similar overall appearance to the previous model. These leaks suggest a significant design shift, featuring curved corners and slimmer bezels, moving away from the previous squared-off aesthetic. The Galaxy S25 series is anticipated to launch on Jan. 22 next year. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: Counterpoint Research stated in May that Samsung’s Galaxy S24 series dominated the GenAI-capable smartphone market in the first quarter of 2024. The South Korean smartphone manufacturer reported a net income of 9.78 trillion won ($7.1 billion) for the quarter ending in September. By the third quarter of 2024, Samsung Electronics’ Mobile Experience (MX) division generated roughly $21.6 billion, according to Statista, making it the largest revenue contributor.

2024-12-17 17:58:10,AAPL,!Market Breadth Worsens As Tech Giants Break Free From S&P 500 Reality: Is This Bullish Or Bearish For 2025?,BZ$1989db2e,BZ,"The performance gap between the cap-weighted S&P 500 — tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) — and its equal-weighted sibling, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE: RSP ), has blown out to over 4 percentage points in December. This marks the widest monthly gap since May 2023, reflecting how a narrow group of stocks is shouldering the market's returns in the last month of the year. As of Dec. 17, only 90 out of 500 stocks in the S&P 500 are in positive territory month-to-date, a shockingly narrow market breadth. Excluding Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), all of the Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ), and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) — have posted gains this month. If Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO ), which recently surpassed the $1 trillion market-cap threshold, is added to the mix, an equal-weighted portfolio of these eight stocks has already delivered a stunning 16% return so far in December. That stands in stark contrast to the broader market's struggles as the equal-weighted S&P 500 index fell by 3% month to date. Name Price Chg. % (MTD) Market Cap ($) Broadcom Inc. 48.27 1.12 trillion Tesla, Inc. 37.03 1.52 trillion Alphabet Inc. 16.72 2.43 trillion Amazon.com, Inc. 11.18 2.43 trillion Meta Platforms, Inc. 9.15 1.58 trillion Microsoft Corporation 7.25 3.38 trillion Apple Inc. 6.52 3.82 trillion NVIDIA Corporation -5.94 3.18 trillion Average 16.26% Weak Breadth: Bad Sign Or Hidden Opportunity? Ryan Detrick, CMT , chief market strategist at Carson Group LLC, highlighted a notable trend. The S&P 500 has now posted 11 consecutive days of more decliners than advancers, tying the longest streak since 1996. While many investors might view this as a bearish signal, historical data paints a surprisingly different picture. ""Many claim this is bearish, but is it?"" Detrick stated. ""Looking at the longest streaks ever actually appears to be rather bullish. Significant outperformance across the board out one year."" Here's how the S&P 500 performed historically following similar stretches of negative breadth: Date Days of Negative Breadth 1-Month 3-Months 6-Months 1-Year 9/10/1991 8 -2.1% -1.4% 6.0% 7.9% 6/20/1996 11 -4.3% 3.2% 10.5% 35.6% 12/24/2018 8 13.3% 19.3% 23.9% 37.1% Average — 3.0% 4.8% 8.6% 14.8% All Years Avg (1950–2023) 0.7% 2.2% 4.4% 9.0% Notably, the historical data shows that returns tend to improve significantly over the next year, with 87.5% of cases showing positive performance after a prolonged stretch of weak breadth. In essence, bad breadth doesn't necessarily spell bad news. If history holds, weak market participation could signal stronger returns ahead. Yet investors may have to deal with an increase in volatility and potential for sharp pullbacks. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, took a more pessimistic view on the S&P 500's 11-day streak of decliners outpacing gainers. “The last time this occurred was on June 20, 1996 — only days before a sharp 10% drawdown over the following month that ended almost directly on support from the rising 200-dma. While this does not imply a market top or even correction is imminent, it does add to the evidence of potentially weak footing underneath this latest advance,” he stated. Growth Sectors Shine, But Broader Rebounds Possible The performance story has become sharply sector-specific. Stephen Suttmeier, CFA, CMT , analyst at Bank of America, indicated that December's gains have been heavily concentrated in growth sectors, such as Discretionary, Communications Services and Technology. ""All other sectors showed a negative performance,"" Suttmeier said, highlighting the underperformance of the equal-weighted S&P 500 ETF (RSP). Yet, he remains cautiously optimistic, suggesting of potential “rebounds into year-end for both the NYSE Composite Index (NYA) and RSP.""

2024-12-17 15:01:12,AAPL,"Market Clubhouse Morning Memo - December 17th, 2024 (Trade Strategy For SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META and TSLA)",BZ$19893e23,BZ,"Good Morning Traders! In today’s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let’s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) The SPY is currently trading around our critical level of 605.41. Bulls will want to see a steady push above 606.34 and hold this level as firm support. If buyers maintain control, we expect momentum to carry the price toward 607.55. A successful hold at 607.55 could encourage further bullish activity, pushing SPY up to 608.35. If buying strength persists, the high bull target for the session is set at 609.33. Should 605.41 fail to hold as support, bears will aim to drive the auction lower to 604.45. Increased selling pressure could lead to a test of 603.38. If sellers maintain dominance and break through 603.38, we have strong support at 602.37. In the event of an aggressive selloff, our low bear target for SPY on the day is 601.22. I nvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ) The QQQ is auctioning around the key level of 536.95. Bulls will look for this level to hold firm as support, allowing buyers to target 539.02 as the next upside level. A decisive break above 539.02 may bring 540.60 into play. Continued upward momentum and strength could test higher at 542.31. If the auction remains bullish, the high bull target for the session is 543.58. If 536.95 fails to hold during regular trading hours, bears will take the opportunity to push the price lower to 535.30. Continued weakness could lead to a test of 533.70. If sellers are persistent and break through this level, we anticipate a move toward 532.52. Failure at 532.52 may open the door for bears to push QQQ down to the low bear target of 530.70. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple is currently auctioning near our support level of 250.39. Bulls need to hold this level and push higher to test 252.13 as the next area of interest. A strong move above 252.13 could lead to further upside momentum, targeting 253.90. If buyers remain in control, we expect a rally toward our high bull target of 256.09 for the session. If 250.39 fails as support during the session, sellers will aim to drive the price lower toward 249.04. Continued bearish pressure may bring 248.12 into focus. If this level breaks under heavy selling, the bears will look to push Apple further down to 246.72. In a more aggressive selloff scenario, the low bear target for the day is 245.58. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Microsoft is auctioning near the key support level of 450.26. Bulls will aim to defend this level and push higher to test 453.02 as the next upside objective. If buyers succeed in holding above 453.02, we anticipate a rally toward 455.77. Sustained bullish momentum could see the auction push up to the high bull target for the session at 457.25. On the downside, if 450.26 fails to hold as support, sellers will look to test the strength of 448.18. Continued bearish control could lead to a breakdown to 446.33. Should sellers intensify their push lower, the price may move to 444.95. A particularly weak session could see Microsoft reach the low bear target of 442.95. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) NVIDIA is currently auctioning around the key level of 129.53. Bulls need to push higher and reclaim 131.42 as a solid level of support. If buying strength continues, the next level to watch is 132.19. A sustained rally could lead to a push toward 133.31. If bulls remain in control, our high bull target for the day is set at 134.56. If 129.53 fails to hold as support, bears will look to test lower at 128.10. Continued selling could bring 126.84 into play as the next downside target. If weakness persists and sellers dominate the session, we anticipate a test of 125.21. In a more aggressive sell-side scenario, the low bear target for NVIDIA is 123.41. Al phabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Alphabet is auctioning around the critical level of 196.25. Bulls will look to defend this level and push the price toward 196.97 as the next upside objective. Continued strength could lead to a test of 197.79, which serves as our high bull target for the session. Should 196.25 fail as support, sellers will aim to push Alphabet lower to 195.41. If this level breaks, bears will likely test 194.34. In the case of further downside momentum, we expect the auction to move toward our low bear target for the day at 193.14. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ) Meta is trading around 622.01, a critical level for bulls to maintain. If this support holds, a push toward 629.88 could be expected. Continued buying pressure might lead to a test of 635.49, with further bullish momentum bringing the high bull target of 642.59 into play. If 622.01 breaks as support, bears could drive the price down to 615.65. Further selling might target 609.30, with heavy bearish momentum potentially taking Meta to the low bear target at 604.50. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Tesla is currently auctioning around our key level of 471.48. Bulls need to push higher and reclaim 480.83 as a firm level of support. Continued strength in the broader market could see Tesla rally toward 492.46. If buying accelerates, the next upside target to watch is 502.25. The high bull target for Tesla today is 511.58. On the downside, if 471.48 is lost, bears will aim for a move lower to 462.12. Further selling could bring 454.90 into play. Should this level fail to hold, sellers may target Tesla down to the low bear level of 448.48 during the session. Final Word: Today's trading session features several key economic reports that could influence market sentiment. At 8:30 AM ET, we'll see the release of November's Advance Retail Sales alongside the New York Fed Services Business Activity report for December. Canadian CPI data for November will also be released at the same time, which could impact broader markets.

At 10:00 AM ET, Business Inventories for October and the NAHB Housing Market Index for December will be released. These data points will give a clearer picture of economic momentum heading into year-end. A notable event to watch this afternoon is the 20-Year Bond Auction at 1:00 PM ET, which could lead to shifts in the bond market and potentially impact equities. Today's session is expected to bring heightened volatility as traders position ahead of tomorrow's FOMC rate decision.

2024-12-17 15:00:30,AAPL,"Comparing Apple With Industry Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$19893df4,BZ,"In today's rapidly changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, it is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts to thoroughly analyze companies. In this article, we will conduct a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) against its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.

The elevated Price to Book ratio of 66.63 relative to the industry average by 10.53x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. The Price to Sales ratio of 9.89 , which is 4.45x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% that is 15.8% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion is 95.59x above the industry average, highlighting stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. With a revenue growth of 6.07% , which is much lower than the industry average of 166.6% , the company is experiencing a notable slowdown in sales expansion. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is an important measure to assess the financial structure and risk profile of a company. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By evaluating Apple against its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following observations arise: Among its top 4 peers, Apple is placed in the middle with a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . This implies a balanced financial structure, with a reasonable proportion of debt and equity. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, despite slower revenue growth. Overall, Apple's financial performance is solid, with room for potential growth in the future. This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.

2024-12-17 13:19:35,AAPL,!How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,BZ$1989100a,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares closed higher, surging to fresh highs on Monday . JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee shone a spotlight on Apple’s prospects for 2025, crafting a dual-path thesis: a bullish case with AI-powered upgrades and another without the AI buzz. While Apple Intelligence could drive the iPhone 17 cycle and Services revenue, Chatterjee insisted the bull case doesn’t hinge solely on AI — Apple’s premium ecosystem, margins and Services growth could carry the torch. With the recent buzz around Apple ahead of quarterly earnings, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.40%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple's $1.00 dividend: $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,506,240 worth of Apple, or 6,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares, or $301,248 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained by 1.2% to close at $251.04 on Monday.

2024-12-17 12:22:53,AAPL,"!DR Congo Fires 'First Salvo,' Files Complaints Against Apple Over Conflict Minerals",BZ$1988ecfc,BZ,"The Democratic Republic of Congo has filed criminal complaints against Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), accusing the company of using conflict minerals . The complaints are filed against Apple's subsidiaries in France and Belgium, per a Reuters report. What happened? Lawyers representing the Congolese government revealed the legal action against Apple France, Apple Retail France, and Apple Retail Belgium. These complaints, prepared by the firm Amsterdam & Partners , came after months of investigation that began earlier this year . Robert Amsterdam , known for his involvement in international litigation and emerging markets, called this action the ""first salvo."" The complaints allege that Apple is complicit in laundering minerals sourced from conflict zones, covering up war crimes, handling stolen goods, and misleading consumers about its supply chain practices. ""It is clear that the Apple group, Apple France, and Apple Retail France know very well that their mineral supply chain relies on systemic wrongdoing,"" the French complaint states. According to the Reuters report, Christophe Marchand , a lawyer representing Congo, pointed out Belgium's moral responsibility due to its colonial past in Congo. The judicial systems in both nations will decide whether to advance these complaints. Benzinga has contacted Apple for comment on this report. Why it matters? Eastern Congo has long been marred by conflict fueled by competition over mineral wealth, particularly tin, tantalum, tungsten (3T minerals), and gold. Armed groups control many artisanal mines, using profits from smuggled minerals to fund violence and forced labor. As these minerals are critical components in electronics, the region's instability is a global concern. Earlier this year, the U.S. State Department acknowledged the issue , clarifying that the steps taken to help curb the illicit flows of these minerals include encouraging responsible investment in and sourcing from the region and identifying stronger due diligence mechanisms. Despite Apple's claims of strict oversight, issues in regional supply chains raise questions. Apple's 2023 conflict minerals report stated that 100% of identified smelters and refiners in its supply chain for 3T minerals and gold underwent independent third-party audits. However, U.S. data from 2021 revealed that Rwanda accounted for 15% of the global tantalum supply despite modest production capacities. This discrepancy suggests that smuggled Congolese minerals may be falsely labeled as Rwandan. Price Action: AAPL stock is down by 0.33% to $250.21 premarket at the last check on Monday.

Cues From The Last Session Tech stocks continued their upward trajectory on Monday, with the Nasdaq 100 index surging over 1.4%. Key index components drove this rally. Broadcom Inc. led the charge, skyrocketing over 11% after receiving favorable analyst ratings. The company’s AI-driven growth potential was further bolstered by its recent announcement of a partnership with Apple Inc. to develop a cutting-edge AI chip. Tesla Inc also experienced significant gains, climbing more than 6%. This surge extended its post-election rally, fueled by positive analyst sentiment. Wedbush Securities highlighted Tesla’s potential as a “game-changer” in AI and autonomous driving under the Trump administration. Other indices also saw positive momentum, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.64% and the S&P 500 edging up 0.38%.

Insights From Analysts As the market continues to exhibit resilience, driven by hopes of AI-led growth and reduced regulatory hurdles, the actual economic impact of AI adoption is still some time away, said Jeremy Siegel . “This disconnect between potential and reality allows the bullish sentiment surrounding the sector to persist,” he added. Siegel is a senior economist at WisdomTree and emeritus professor of finance at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. “A rotation into neglected areas of the market, such as value or small-cap stocks, could materialize in 2025 if regulatory reforms and easing financial conditions create a more favorable backdrop for these non-tech segments. Investors should remain vigilant as tech valuations climb further, with an eye toward rebalancing opportunities early next year,” Siegel wrote in his weekly market commentary. The chief market strategist at Carson Group, Ryan Detrick spoke about the continued skewness in the market breadth, in an X post. He asked a rhetorical question “Many claim this (trend) is bearish, but is it?” According to the data shared by him, the last time market breadth was in the favour of decliners for 11 days, the index rose by 35.6% over the next year. “Looking at the longest streaks ever actually appears to be rather bullish. Significant outperformance across the board out one year,” he added. 11 days in a row with more decliners than advancers on the S&P 500, ties longest streak since 1990.

What Happened : Speaking on CNBC’s “Closing Bell,” Ives described Trump’s incoming administration as a “Goldilocks scenario” for tech companies, citing expected regulatory relief from agencies including the Federal Trade Commission. “Let’s get the popcorn out for what will be the AI revolution,” Ives said, emphasizing that the sector’s current surge is “just getting started.” He explained that AI’s multiplier effect is spreading across the technology landscape, impacting everything from software to cybersecurity infrastructure. The analyst expects 80% to 90% of regulatory concerns to diminish under Trump, though some Department of Justice antitrust investigations into companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will continue.

The forecast comes as multiple tech CEOs plan meetings with the president-elect in Palm Beach, signaling potentially closer cooperation between Silicon Valley and the incoming administration.

The facility, covering 3.5 million square feet on a 1,100-acre site, represents Taiwan Semiconductor’s commitment to bolstering domestic chip manufacturing. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is its largest customer. Initially projected at $12 billion, the project has grown to $20 billion, and production has been delayed to 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor stock is trading upwards on Monday. Also Read: Apple’s 2025 Chip Transition Targets New Wireless Edge, Broadcom To Retain Key Role Currently in pilot production, the fab manufactures sample wafers for customer verification, CNBC reports . Taiwan Semiconductor plans to build two additional fabs on the site by the end of the decade, bringing the total investment to $65 billion. Rick Cassidy, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor, highlighted to CNBC the challenges of navigating U.S. regulations, labor laws, and construction processes but expressed confidence that the project is nearly back on its original schedule. Once operational, the Arizona plant will produce 4-nanometer chips at a rate of 20,000 wafers per month. The Arizona fab is part of a broader strategy to diversify chip production outside Taiwan, ensuring supply chain resilience amid geopolitical tensions and natural disasters. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is weighing the production of the front-end process of Blackwell AI chips at Taiwan Semiconductor’s Arizona plant. Currently, 92% of the world’s most advanced chips are made in Taiwan, prompting Taiwan Semiconductor to ship the aforementioned Blackwell chips back to Taiwan for packaging. The company aims to employ 6,000 workers for its three planned fabs in Arizona. Taiwan Semiconductor has also implemented water recycling initiatives to manage the 4.7 million gallons required daily for operations, reducing consumption to 1 million through sustainable practices. Running the first Arizona fab requires significant power—2.85 gigawatt-hours per day, equivalent to the usage of 100,000 homes. Taiwan Semiconductor is offsetting this demand by purchasing renewable energy credits and utilizing on-site solar energy. International Data Corp expects Taiwan Semiconductor to control a 67% share of the global foundry market in 2025, backed by AI applications and crypto-mining technologies. Taiwan Semiconductor posted third-quarter revenue of $23.50 billion, up 39%, surpassing guidance and estimates, driven by strong demand for 3nm and 5nm technologies. Needham analyst Charles Shi highlighted Apple’s significant contribution to the robust 3nm performance . Price Action: TSM stock is up 1.67% at $204.29 premarket at last check Monday.

2024-12-16 17:24:38,AAPL,!Apple's 2025 Bull Case: Can It Deliver Without Riding The AI Wave?,BZ$19868b29,BZ,"JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee shone a spotlight on Apple Inc 's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) prospects for 2025, crafting a dual-path thesis: a bullish case with AI-powered upgrades and another without the AI buzz. While Apple Intelligence could drive the iPhone 17 cycle and Services revenue, Chatterjee insisted the bull case doesn't hinge solely on AI — Apple's premium ecosystem, margins and Services growth could carry the torch. AI On The Horizon: The Bull Case For Apple Stock The optimistic scenario hinges on a volume upcycle tied to the iPhone 17, launching in late 2025. iPhone shipments are forecast to climb from 230 million units in FY25 to 263 million by FY27, fueled by consumer upgrades for AI-enabled features. ""Margins remain underappreciated,"" Chatterjee noted, as commodity price tailwinds and vertical integration offset costs. The analyst highlighted Services revenue, growing at a ""mid-teens rate,"" added a potent profitability lever, accounting for 44% of total gross profits by FY27. Chatterjee projected a 9% revenue CAGR and 16% earnings CAGR, dubbing AI as a material driver for Apple's valuation multiple. “Our bull case forecasts with AI, supporting premium valuation,” he said. Read Also: Apple’s 2025 AirTag To Feature iPhone 15’s Ultrawide-Band Chip For Smarter, Longer-Range Tracking: Report Apple: Bullish Outlook Even Without AI Even if AI fails to spark a volume boom, Chatterjee underscored a resilient foundation: the iPhone “replacement rate as a percentage of the installed base is at an all-time low,” limiting downside. Services growth and product gross margin improvements continue to drive aggregate margin expansion. ""Excluding AI, we anticipate that mid-single-digit revenue growth will support earnings growth in the +8% to +10% range, aided by margin expansion and share buybacks,"" he said. China: The Wildcard Chatterjee saw China as a wildcard. Improved consumer spending in that country could support upside volumes, irrespective of AI adoption, he said. Meanwhile, Apple's strategy to diversify assembly outside China, notably in India, could cushion tariff-related headwinds. The Verdict On Apple Stock Apple's stock might straddle a range-bound path in 2025, but Chatterjee said, ""the valuation multiple is likely to remain intact until further demand data points emerges on the iPhone 17 cycle."" Whether powered by AI or old-school fundamentals, Apple seems poised to sustain its premium stature — and its investors' confidence.

2024-12-16 17:16:47,AAPL,!Elon Musk's Tesla Nearly 5 Times More Expensive Than Industry Average: Stock Surges Over 60% Since Election,BZ$198682d1,BZ,"Elon Musk ‘s Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has surged over 60% since the 2024 election results were announced, making it nearly five times more expensive than the industry average. Additionally, its technical indicators flash overbought warnings. Despite this, Wedbush’s Dan Ives has increased his price target on the stock to $515 apiece, citing optimism around a potential “game changer” under a Trump administration. What Happened: Tesla shares are trading at a price nearly 126 times over its 2025 earnings, according to Benzinga Pro data. At the same time, the average forward price-to-earnings of its peers stand at 25.75 times, implying that Tesla is over five times more expensive than its industry’s average. When compared with other Magnificent Seven stocks and Broadcom, Tesla shares are the most expensive and it has the highest ratio of forward price-to-earnings. Stocks Forward P/E Industry Average Tesla 126.582 25.75 Apple 33.333 20.23 Alphabet 21.552 125.77 Meta 24.450 125.77 Amazon 36.630 32.14 Nvidia 31.546 37.03 Broadcom 36.765 37.03 Microsoft 34.014 81.74 – Benzinga Pro Data See Also: Gold Poised For Its Best Year In A Decade While Bitcoin Surges: Analysts Eye 2025 As A Golden Era For Precious Metal Amid Michael Saylor’s Push For BTC As A Reserve Asset Why It Matters: Shares of Tesla have risen over 60% since Nov. 6, outpacing gains in the Nasdaq 100 index, which advanced by 7% in the same period. On a year-to-date basis, TSLA is up approximately 84%. Thus, its post-election trajectory has significantly altered the narrative, converting a relatively subdued performance into a highly successful year for Tesla investors. Performance Nasdaq 100 Tesla Stock Since Nov. 6 7% 60% Year To Date 33% 84% Five Year 153% 1597% – Benzinga Pro Data From a technical perspective, the analysis of daily moving averages and its relative strength indicate that the stock price is high and overbought. TSLA closed at $436.23 on Friday. This was below above the eight and 20-day simple moving averages, of $408.55 and $370.43, respectively. As per Benzinga Pro data , its current stock price is also much higher than the 50 and 200-day moving average prices at $303.86 and $225.59, respectively. The relative strength index of 79.17 also suggests the stock is overbought. These combined factors usually mean the stock may be overvalued, and there could be a potential for a price correction or a pullback. Benzinga’s technical analysis scorecard scores the company at 66 points out of 100. What Are Analysts Saying: Ives raised his Tesla price target to $515, citing a potential “game changer” under a Trump presidency. He believes that the Trump administration will favor Tesla’s AI and autonomous driving initiatives while hindering smaller EV competitors. Ives sees a $2 trillion market cap for Tesla by 2025, excluding potential value from its Optimus robot. This comes amid reports of the Trump team seeking to relax regulations on autonomous vehicles, a move Tesla has advocated for. We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2025 as the company's autonomous vision starts to take shape. Importantly, our price target conservatively assumes no value today for Optimus which could be a major upside catalyst for the Tesla story 🔥🏆🐂🍿👇 https://t.co/IBxilcLgC3 — Dan Ives (@DivesTech) December 15, 2024 Ives has always been bullish on the Elon Musk -led company. “Tesla is the most undervalued AI name in the market in our view,” said Ives in an X post dated Nov. 11. Tesla has a consensus ""buy"" rating based on the ratings of 33 analysts tracked by Benzinga . Price Action: Shares of Tesla were up 5.4% at $459.81 at the time of publication Monday, while Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ) was up 1.1% at $536.78.

2024-12-16 15:01:15,AAPL,"Market Clubhouse Morning Memo - December 16th, 2024 (Trade Strategy For SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META and TSLA)",BZ$1985f224,BZ,"Good Morning Traders! In today’s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let’s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) The SPY is currently trading near 605.41. For the bulls, holding above this level is critical to sustain upward momentum. A successful push past 606.34 could signal strength and potentially lead to a test of 607.55 as a new area of support. If buyers maintain control above 607.55, the next target would be a move towards 608.35. The high bull target for the day is positioned at 609.33, representing a strong showing for the bulls. On the other hand, if SPY fails to hold 605.41 as support, sellers may gain momentum and aim for 604.45 as the next significant level. A break below this could lead to further downside toward 603.38, with heavier selling pressure potentially targeting 602.37. In a more pronounced bearish session, SPY may see a drop to the low bear target at 601.22. I nvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ) The QQQ is currently hovering around the 532.52 level. For bullish traders, holding this level as support is crucial to enable a rally higher. If buyers step in above 532.52, the next objective would be to secure 533.70 as a support zone. Further bullish momentum could lead to a test of 535.30, with a continued push potentially targeting 536.95. The high bull target for QQQ stands at 539.02, signaling a strong day for the bulls if reached. If 532.52 does not hold as support during the trading session, bears could take charge, driving the price down to 530.70. Continued weakness might result in a test of 528.44, with sellers aiming for a more significant move down to 527.03. In a sharp selloff scenario, QQQ could reach the low bear target at 525.19. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple is trading near 248.12, and bulls will want to see this level hold as support to maintain upward momentum. A rally above this level could bring 249.04 into play as a key resistance turned support. Continued strength in the auction may propel Apple towards 250.39, with a strong bullish session potentially driving the price to the high bull target at 252.13. If 248.12 fails as support, sellers could push Apple lower to test 246.72. A breach of this level might expose the stock to further downside at 245.58, with a continuation of bearish pressure targeting 244.45. If selling intensifies, the low bear target for the day is set at 243.57. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Microsoft is currently trading near 448.18. For the bulls, maintaining support above this level is essential to drive the price higher. A breakout above 450.26 could pave the way for further upside, targeting 453.02. Continued buying momentum might lift MSFT to the high bull target for the day at 455.77. Conversely, if 448.18 fails to hold as support, the bears may look to test 446.33. A sustained breakdown below this level could lead to further declines, with 444.95 as the next target. Should bearish momentum persist, MSFT could drop to 442.95, with the low bear target sitting at 441.34. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) NVIDIA is auctioning near 138.55, a key level for gauging bullish interest. If the price can hold above 138.55, bulls are likely to target 139.42. Sustained buying activity could drive the price higher to 140.28, with additional momentum potentially taking the stock to 141.21. The high bull target for today is set at 142.35. If NVIDIA struggles to hold 138.55, bears could push the price lower to test 137.94. A breakdown at this level might result in a move toward 136.98. Should selling pressure remain strong, 135.64 is the next key level, with 134.56 marking the low bear target for today's session. Al phabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Alphabet is currently trading near 191.45. Bulls will want to defend this level to initiate a move higher, with 192.19 being the next key resistance to claim. A sustained bullish push could target 193.14, representing the high bull target for the day. If 191.45 fails to hold during regular trading hours, bears may take the reins and push the price lower to 190.41. A break below this level could trigger additional selling to 189.57. In an extended bearish session, Alphabet might reach the low bear target at 188.73. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ) Meta is trading around 622.01, a critical level for bulls to maintain. If this support holds, a push toward 629.88 could be expected. Continued buying pressure might lead to a test of 635.49, with further bullish momentum bringing the high bull target of 642.59 into play. If 622.01 breaks as support, bears could drive the price down to 615.65. Further selling might target 609.30, with heavy bearish momentum potentially taking Meta to the low bear target at 604.50. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Tesla is currently trading near 437.95, a key level for bulls to defend. A breakout above this level could lead to a test of 448.48. Continued strength might push the price to 454.90, with a bullish session potentially targeting the high bull level at 462.12. If the rally sustains strong buyer interest, Tesla could aim for the high bull target at 471.48. Should 437.95 fail as support, the bears might push Tesla lower to test 431.50. A breakdown below this level could result in a move to 426.23, with sustained selling pressure likely driving the price to the low bear target of 420.70. Final Word: The economic calendar today offers several key data points that could shape the market narrative. At 8:30 AM ET, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for December will be released, providing insights into regional manufacturing conditions. Later, at 9:45 AM ET, the Preliminary S&P Global Manufacturing and Services PMI will offer a broader view of economic activity. These reports are crucial indicators of business activity and sentiment heading into the end of the year. Additionally, at 11:30 AM ET, the Treasury will conduct a 3 and 6 month bill auction, which could impact short-term interest rates and liquidity conditions. With the FOMC rate decision looming on Wednesday, traders should remain vigilant for any market moves or sentiment shifts ahead of this pivotal event.

2024-12-16 15:00:30,AAPL,"Competitor Analysis: Evaluating Apple And Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$1985f1d1,BZ,"Amidst the fast-paced and highly competitive business environment of today, conducting comprehensive company analysis is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will delve into an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in comparison to its major competitors within the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing critical financial metrics, market position, and growth potential, our objective is to provide valuable insights for investors and offer a deeper understanding of company's performance in the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 40.81 65.86 9.78 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.31 1.14 0.97 5.72% $1.23 $2.44 9.7% NetApp Inc 22.46 27.80 3.98 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 71.56 1.93 1.52 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 18.14 3.90 1.47 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 163.33 14.73 7.37 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Eastman Kodak Co 9.71 0.56 0.59 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 56.71 3.47 1.05 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 5.10 1.28 1.81 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 27.73 1.15 0.70 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 42.89 6.22 2.16 7.96% $0.34 $0.72 167.32% By thoroughly analyzing Apple, we can discern the following trends: With a Price to Earnings ratio of 40.81 , which is 0.95x less than the industry average, the stock shows potential for growth at a reasonable price, making it an interesting consideration for market participants. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 65.86 relative to the industry average by 10.59x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.78 , which is 4.53x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance. The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% , which is 15.87% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential. The company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. With a revenue growth of 6.07% , which is much lower than the industry average of 167.32% , the company is experiencing a notable slowdown in sales expansion. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a financial metric that helps determine the level of financial risk associated with a company's capital structure. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By analyzing Apple in relation to its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be derived: Apple holds a middle position in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates a balanced financial structure with a moderate level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales highly. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability, while the low revenue growth may indicate a need for expansion strategies to align with industry trends.

2024-12-16 13:00:16,AAPL,How Is The Market Feeling About Apple?,BZ$1985b8db,BZ,"Apple's (NYSE: AAPL ) short percent of float has risen 9.68% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 154.10 million shares sold short , which is 1.02% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 3.55 days to cover their short positions on average. Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish. See Also: List of the most shorted stocks Apple Short Interest Graph (3 Months) As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Apple has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted. Comparing Apple's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro , Apple's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 7.50%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers. Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is reportedly gearing up to launch a redesigned AirTag in 2025 with better tracking capabilities and range. What Happened: In the latest installment of the weekly ""Power On"" newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said that the updated AirTag will feature a next-generation ultrawide-band chip, previously seen in iPhone 15 . This will result in AirTag 2 offering a range three times greater than the current model, which can be located from 10 to 30 meters away using Precision Finding . In addition, the new AirTag is expected to include improved security features, to make it easier for users to locate items to which the AirTag is attached. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: The much-anticipated 2025 AirTag redesign comes amid ongoing discussions about the device’s security and privacy implications. Earlier this year, Apple faced a lawsuit alleging that AirTags were being misused by stalkers. The lawsuit, which Apple failed to dismiss, highlighted concerns about the potential misuse of the tracking device. In response to such concerns, Apple has been working on improving the security features of its AirTags. The upcoming model is expected to address these issues. However, AirTags have also proven effective in various situations , such as aiding in the recovery of stolen items. Last month, Apple also introduced a feature allowing users to share the location of lost items with third parties, such as airlines, through the Find My app. Check out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link .

2024-12-16 03:41:37,AAPL,Apple Eyes 2026 To Launch Foldable iPhones And Ultralight Devices As It Looks To Revitalize Sales Momentum: Report,BZ$1984c5a6,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is reportedly planning to launch foldable iPhones and ultralight devices by 2026. What Happened: Apple is reportedly working on a thinner iPhone model , expected to be more affordable than the Pro versions. This device will feature a simplified camera system to cut costs, reported The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The tech giant is also developing two foldable devices: a larger one that unfolds to a 19-inch screen, and a smaller foldable iPhone, the sources noted. Challenges in hinge and display cover technology have delayed these foldable designs, but Apple is pushing for a 2026 release. See Also: Elon Musk Finds An Unlikely Ally In Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta In His Fight Against Sam Altman’s OpenAI While Apple initially planned to launch the larger foldable device first to assess market reception, it now seems that the foldable iPhone will likely debut earlier. Executives are targeting a 2026 release for the foldable iPhone, though an additional year may be required to resolve ongoing technical issues, the report noted, citing sources. Meanwhile, the ultrathin iPhone is expected to cater to consumers who prioritize a sleek design over some of the advanced features found in the Pro models. Analyst Jeff Pu from Haitong International Securities noted that current foldable phones do not meet Apple’s standards for thinness, lightness, and energy efficiency. Apple did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: This move aims to boost consumer interest amid stagnant smartphone sales. Apple’s iPhone business, which contributes significantly to its revenue, has seen minimal growth. The company is seeking new ways to accelerate growth. Earlier in August, it was reported that Apple is working on a thinner version of the iPhone 17, dubbed the “Air,” which could potentially reignite consumer interest in its flagship product. The device could be a significant redesign akin to the iPhone X. Apple’s smartphone sales saw a slight 0.3% decline year-over-year in the third quarter, yet demand for the iPhone 16 series remained steady compared to previous models, according to an IDC report. This performance enabled Apple to regain the second spot in China's smartphone market, securing a 15.6% share. In October, Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, surpassing analyst projections of $94.56 billion. iPhone sales contributed $46.22 billion, up from $43.8 billion in the same period last year. On Sunday, Mark Gurman in his latest installment of the weekly ""Power On"" newsletter reported that Apple is exploring the tablet market with a potential 18.8-inch foldable iPad by 2028. This device is expected to offer a seamless experience, similar to using two iPad Pros side-by-side, and may incorporate features from both Macs and iPads. Price Action: Apple’s stock edged up 0.069% on Friday, finishing the day at $248.13. Year-to-date, the company’s shares have increased by 33.66%. The latest price targets from Morgan Stanley , Needham , and Wedbush suggest an average target of $277.67, indicating a potential upside of 11.96%, according to Benzinga Pro data .

2024-12-15 20:15:30,AAPL,!Could Apple Set Revolutionize Tablet Market With 18.8-Inch Foldable iPad?,BZ$19849b12,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may be gearing up to introduce an 18.8-inch foldable iPad by 2028. The innovative device is expected to provide users with a seamless experience, similar to using “two iPad Pros side-by-side.” Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman in his latest weekly ""Power On"" newsletter shared that Apple’s industrial design team has successfully developed prototypes of the foldable iPad. The device, which has been a subject of speculation for years, is rumored to have a smaller version launching between 2026 and 2027. In his newsletter, Gurman compared the upcoming device to the 20-inch folding “iPad / MacBook hybrid” he talked about in 2022. Gurman believes that the new iPad will incorporate features from both Macs and iPads. By 2028, he expects the iPadOS to be sophisticated enough to run macOS apps. It is my impression that much of Apple's current work on foldable screen technology is focused on this higher-end device, but it's also been exploring the idea of a foldable iPhone. — Mark Gurman (@markgurman) December 15, 2024 Considering that Macs currently support iPhone and iPad apps, the idea of the reverse happening is not far-fetched. This could significantly boost the device’s value proposition, especially given that the 13-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,299. Also Read: Apple Eyes Sony Partnership For Game-Changing Vision Pro Upgrade Gurman also hinted at the development of a foldable iPhone, although its release is not anticipated “before 2026 at the earliest”. He added that his sources corroborate a recent alleged Apple internal display roadmap, which suggests the launch of the 18.8-inch foldable iPad and the release of OLED MacBook Pros in 2026, followed by a MacBook Air OLED update in 2027. The introduction of the foldable iPad is a testament to Apple’s commitment to innovation and user experience. The device, which combines the functionalities of an iPad and a Mac, could potentially redefine the tablet market. Moreover, the ability to run macOS apps on the iPadOS could blur the lines between tablets and laptops, offering users a more versatile and compact computing solution. The rumored foldable iPhone further indicates Apple’s plan to expand its foldable device portfolio, which could significantly impact the smartphone market.

The meeting is part of a series of visits by tech leaders to Florida , including Meta Platforms, Inc.'s Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet Inc . CEO Sundar Pichai .

Previously, it was reported that Apple and Nvidia Corp. suppliers are preparing for potential shifts in trade policies, with companies like Foxconn ready to expand U.S. operations if necessary.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google to prepare for the removal of ByteDance -owned TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. What Happened: This move follows a federal appeals court ruling that requires ByteDance to divest TikTok in the U.S. or face a ban. Representatives John Moolenaar and Raja Krishnamoorthi have urged TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew to sell the app, which is used by 170 million Americans, reported Reuters. “Congress has acted decisively to defend the national security of the United States and protect TikTok's American users from the Chinese Communist Party.

Year-to-date, the index has posted a robust 30% gain, on track to outperform the S&P 500 for the ninth time in the last decade. Since the start of 2023, the Nasdaq 100 is on track to double, nearing a 100% gain – a performance last achieved in 2019-2020 with a 102% rise and previously hit during the dot-com boom of 1998-1999.

The rally propelled the chipmaker into the exclusive $1 trillion market-cap club, making it the eighth-largest publicly traded company. Inflation data released during the week raised some red flags. Consumer inflation rose 2.7% year-over-year in November, in line with expectations, but producer inflation jumped to 3% year-over-year, exceeding estimates of 2.6%.

As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let’s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) SPY is trading near the 606.34 level, which is a critical area for the bulls to defend. If buyers can push the price beyond 607.55 and hold that level as support, we anticipate a further rally towards 608.35. Sustained buying momentum above 608.35 could open the door to a test of 609.33. Should this strength persist, the high bull target for today stands at 610.63. Conversely, if the 606.34 level fails to hold as support, bears are likely to take the price lower to test 605.41. A breakdown below this level could see the auction heading towards 604.45. If selling pressure intensifies, we expect further downside, potentially reaching 603.38. The low bear target for the session is set at 602.37. I nvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ) The QQQ is hovering around the 530.70 mark, with bulls aiming to hold this level as a foundation for upward momentum. Should the price hold firm above 530.70, buyers could target 532.52 as the next area of interest. If this level is reclaimed and sustained, the price may advance towards 533.70. With continued strength, a test of 535.30 is plausible, and the high bull target for the day sits at 536.95. On the flip side, a failure to maintain 530.70 as support could lead to bearish activity driving the price down to 528.44. Sellers may aim to challenge the 527.03 level if downside pressure persists. Further weakness could expose 525.19 as the next key level, with the low bear target of 523.91 in sight for today's session. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple is trading close to 248.12, a pivotal level for determining today's direction. If buyers can hold 248.12 as support, the stock could see an upward move toward 249.04. Sustained bullish momentum may push the price higher to 250.39. In a strong uptrend, Apple could reach 252.13, the high bull target for the day. However, if 248.12 fails as support during regular trading, sellers may take control, driving the price lower to 246.72. Continued bearish momentum could lead to a test of 245.58. If selling intensifies, 244.45 becomes the next critical level, with 243.57 set as the low bear target for the session. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Microsoft is currently positioned near 450.26, with bulls looking to hold this level and push higher. If buying pressure prevails, the next target for bulls is 453.02. A hold above 453.02 could propel the stock toward 455.77. Should the uptrend continue, 457.25 serves as the high bull target for the day. In the event that 450.26 is lost as support, bears may aim to test 448.18. A breakdown below this level could lead to further selling pressure, bringing 446.33 into focus. If the bearish momentum continues, the price might test 444.95, with 442.95 acting as the low bear target for today's trading session. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) NVIDIA is auctioning near 138.55, a key level for gauging bullish interest. If the price can hold above 138.55, bulls are likely to target 139.42. Sustained buying activity could drive the price higher to 140.28, with additional momentum potentially taking the stock to 141.21. The high bull target for today is set at 142.35. If NVIDIA struggles to hold 138.55, bears could push the price lower to test 137.94. A breakdown at this level might result in a move toward 136.98. Should selling pressure remain strong, 135.64 is the next key level, with 134.56 marking the low bear target for today's session. Al phabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Alphabet is trading near 191.45, a critical level for bulls to establish as support. If buyers can maintain control above this level, the price may rise toward 192.19. A sustained rally could extend to 193.14, marking the high bull target for today. On the other hand, if 191.45 is breached, bears are likely to push the price lower to test 190.41. A failure to hold this level could lead to further declines toward 189.57. If bearish momentum persists, the low bear target of 188.73 becomes a potential objective. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ) Meta is trading around 629.88, with bulls aiming to hold this level to support an upward move. If buyers prevail, the next target is 635.49, with the potential for a continued rally toward 642.59. A strong bullish session could see the price testing 646.48, the high bull target for the day. Should 629.88 fail as support, bears are likely to drive the price lower to 622.01. Continued selling pressure could bring 615.65 into play. If the auction remains weak, the price may drop to the low bear target of 609.30 for the session. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Tesla is currently trading near 420.70, with bulls aiming for a breakout. If buyers manage to push the price higher, 426.23 becomes the next level of interest. Sustained buying pressure could see Tesla advancing toward 431.50. If the broader market supports a bullish rally, the price might test 437.95, with 448.48 as the high bull target. On the downside, a failure to hold 420.70 could lead to a test of 416.62. If selling pressure intensifies, bears might aim for 413.10. Should this level give way, Tesla could drop to the low bear target of 407.97. Final Word: Today's session offers traders a relatively calm economic calendar, with the primary focus on the Import Price Index for November at 8:30 AM ET. Although no major economic events are scheduled, it's important to stay vigilant, as low-news days can amplify reactions to unexpected developments or shifts in market sentiment. Additionally, traders should keep an eye on market volume, intraday volatility, and options activity, especially as weekly contracts approach expiration. These factors can lead to sharp and sudden price moves. Stay disciplined, manage risks effectively, and approach the market with caution. Have a great session and enjoy the weekend!

Arya’s optimism stems from three main drivers: AI’s Expanding Footprint : Broadcom’s custom AI chips (ASICs) now serve five major customers, up from three previously. The company's AI-related revenue could soar to a served available market of $60–$90 billion by 2027—up from an estimated $15–$20 billion in 2023. Apple's Steady Demand : Broadcom is expected to maintain its strong relationship with Apple, despite prior concerns about declining content orders. Robust Earnings Growth : Analysts forecast a 15% sales growth and a 20% adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) growth trajectory through 2026, underpinned by Broadcom’s diversified portfolio spanning silicon and infrastructure software. ""Broadcom's AI-driven growth potential and diversified base position it as one of the best opportunities in the chip sector,"" Arya said in a note, justifying their upward revision of earnings per share in fiscal year 2025 and 2026 by 5% and 3%, respectively.

2024-12-13 15:00:28,AAPL,"Exploring The Competitive Space: Apple Versus Industry Peers In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals",BZ$1981cc99,BZ,"In the ever-changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, conducting thorough company analysis is crucial for investors and industry experts. In this article, we will undertake a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and its primary competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By closely examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, our aim is to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 40.78 65.81 9.77 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.31 1.14 0.97 5.72% $1.23 $2.44 9.7% NetApp Inc 22.75 28.15 4.04 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 72.52 1.96 1.54 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 18.88 4.06 1.53 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 160.31 14.46 7.24 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Eastman Kodak Co 9.60 0.55 0.59 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 57.29 3.50 1.06 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 5.07 1.28 1.80 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 29.43 1.22 0.74 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 43.02 6.26 2.17 7.96% $0.34 $0.72 167.32% By conducting a comprehensive analysis of Apple, the following trends become evident: With a Price to Earnings ratio of 40.78 , which is 0.95x less than the industry average, the stock shows potential for growth at a reasonable price, making it an interesting consideration for market participants. With a Price to Book ratio of 65.81 , which is 10.51x the industry average, Apple might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers. With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.77 , which is 4.5x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 15.87% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 6.07% compared to the industry average of 167.32% , which indicates a challenging sales environment. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by evaluating its debt relative to its equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When examining Apple in comparison to its top 4 peers with respect to the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following information becomes apparent: In terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple is positioned in the middle among its top 4 peers. This suggests a relatively balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a moderate level of debt while also utilizing equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales highly. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability, while the low revenue growth may indicate a need for strategic expansion to align with industry trends.

2024-12-12 16:19:00,AAPL,"Market Clubhouse Morning Memo - December 12th, 2024 (Trade Strategy For SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META and TSLA)",BZ$197ecbf6,BZ,"Good Morning Traders! In today’s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let’s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) SPY is currently trading near our key level of 606.34. For bullish momentum to sustain, we'd like to see buyers push the price to 607.55 and hold this level as support. If 607.55 holds steady, we anticipate further buying pressure could propel the price toward 608.35. Continued bullish action may test the next resistance at 609.33, with 610.63 as the high bull target for the session. On the flip side, if 606.34 fails to act as support, bears may aim to test the 605.41 level. A break below 605.41 could invite selling pressure, targeting 604.45. If sellers dominate and push lower, 603.38 becomes the next key support. In the case of a strong selloff, the low bear target for today is 602.37. I nvesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ) The QQQ is auctioning around 528.44, our critical level for today. A firm hold above 528.44 could trigger bullish activity, aiming to reclaim 530.70 as a new support zone. With buying strength intact, we expect the price to climb toward 532.52. If the uptrend remains strong, bulls might look to test 533.70, with a potential move to the high bull target of 535.30. However, if the 528.44 level shows weakness, bears may seize the opportunity to drive the price lower to 527.03. A breakdown below this level could see selling intensify toward 525.19. Persistent selling pressure might further target 523.91, with a drop to 522.57 marking the session's low bear target. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple is trading near 246.72, a pivotal level for the day. A bullish stance requires holding 246.72 as support, which could enable a move to 248.12. Sustained upward momentum may bring 249.04 into focus, potentially setting up a test of 250.39, our high bull target for the session. Should 246.72 fail as a support, we expect bears to press lower to 245.58. If selling persists, 244.45 becomes the next likely target. Continued weakness could lead to a test of 243.57, with the low bear target for Apple today set at 242.83. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Microsoft is currently positioned around 446.33, a crucial level to monitor. Bulls need to secure a hold above 446.33 to establish support and push the price toward 448.18. If this level is reclaimed, we could see further upside action targeting 450.26, with the high bull target sitting at 453.02 for today's session. Conversely, a failure at 446.33 may lead to bearish pressure driving the price to 444.95. A breach of this support could pave the way for a drop to 442.95. If sellers remain active, the next test is at 441.34, with the low bear target for Microsoft resting at 438.72. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) NVIDIA is trading near 138.55, a significant level for the bulls to defend. A move above this level could see buyers driving the price to 139.42 and solidifying this zone as support. With momentum, the price could ascend to 140.28, potentially testing 141.21, with 142.35 as the high bull target. Should 138.55 give way, sellers are likely to target 137.94. Continued bearish activity may test 136.98, and if weakness prevails, we anticipate a further move to 135.64. The low bear target for NVIDIA today stands at 134.56. Al phabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Alphabet is hovering around 196.25, a critical level for today's action. Bulls will aim to maintain 196.25 as support to drive the price toward 196.97. If momentum builds, we expect a climb to 197.79, marking the high bull target for the day. If 196.25 breaks as support, bears may take the price down to 195.41. A breach here could prompt further selling to 194.34, with heavy downside pressure potentially targeting 193.14 as the low bear target. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ) Meta is currently auctioning near 635.49, a key level for bullish continuation. Buyers will want to hold above 635.49 and aim for 642.59. If this level is surpassed, a strong rally may bring 646.48 into play, with the high bull target at 650.56. On the downside, failure to hold 635.49 could result in selling pressure testing 629.88. If bears remain aggressive, we anticipate a move to 622.01. Sustained downside action could push Meta to a low bear target of 615.65. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Tesla is trading near 426.23, a level pivotal for today's bullish outlook. Buyers need to reclaim 431.50 and establish it as support to drive the price toward 437.95. Continued strength could lead to a breakout, with 448.48 and the high bull target of 454.90 in sight. Should 426.23 fail to hold, bears could aim for 420.70. A breakdown of this level may bring 416.62 into focus, and if selling pressure persists, the price could test 413.10, today's low bear target. Final Word: Today's trading session features a packed economic calendar, starting with the ECB Rate Decision at 8:15 AM ET. The release of November's PPI Final Demand, along with Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims at 8:30 AM ET, will be closely watched for signs of inflationary pressures and labor market conditions. At 8:45 AM ET, the ECB press conference is expected to provide further insights into European monetary policy, potentially setting the tone for global markets. Later in the day, the U.S. Treasury will conduct a 4 and 8 week bill auction at 11:30 AM ET, followed by a 30 year bond auction at 1 PM ET. These events are critical for assessing investor sentiment toward U.S. debt and could influence broader market dynamics. Given the range of impactful releases, heightened volatility is anticipated. Traders should remain alert, adapt their strategies to the evolving market landscape, and prioritize risk management. Good luck, and trade wisely!

2024-12-12 16:17:39,AAPL,"Hot Inflation Data But Fed Likely To Ignore It, Musk Becomes First $400 Billion Man",BZ$197eca82,BZ,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Hotter Inflation An enlarged chart of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ). Note the following: This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of TSLA stock is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows the run up in TSLA stock. The chart shows the Arora buy signal after the election. As of this writing, there is 50% gain in about five weeks from the Arora buy signal in TSLA. RSI on the chart shows TSLA stock is overbought. Overbought stocks are susceptible to a pullback. The chart shows the nearest support zone. TSLA stock has added $515B in value since Trump's election. The valuation of Tesla and SpaceX have been rising on the belief that Musk's close association with Trump will help his businesses. The rally in TSLA stock, along with the rising valuation of SpaceX, has made Elon Musk the first man ever to have a net worth of $400B. The move yesterday in TSLA stock was initially triggered by General Motors Co’s (NYSE: GM ) decision to stop development of robotaxis. The buying in TSLA stock on the GM news caused TSLA to breakout above the prior high. This brought in technically oriented buyers who buy the breakouts. The prior high was $414.49 on November 4, 2021. After yesterday's sticky Consumer Price Index data that was not worse than expected, the market was certain the Fed will cut interest rates, so investors aggressively bought big tech stocks. Lower interest rates are good for big tech. Producer Price Index (PPI) data came hotter than expected. Here are the details: Headline PPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus. Core PPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus. The reaction to PPI data is slight selling in stocks, bonds, and gold. In The Arora Report analysis, the Fed is likely to ignore the hotter producer inflation data and cut interest rates next week. Initial jobless claims came at 242K vs. 220K consensus. In The Arora Report analysis, the Fed can use this data as an excuse to cut interest rates given the Fed's dual mandate. To understand extreme positive sentiment right now, all a prudent investor needs to do is look at the valuation of Fartcoin (CRYPTO: FARTCOIN). Fartcoin is now worth $500M. What makes Fartcoin so valuable? It produces a digital fart sound on each transaction. The positive sentiment is being enhanced this morning as President-elect Trump is going to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Switzerland The Swiss National Bank cut interest rates by 50 bps, which was more than expected. This is the largest cut in nearly a decade. Europe The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates by 25 bps as expected. Rate cuts in Europe influence the Fed to also cut interest rates. Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ). In the early trade, money flows are negative in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ), and TSLA. In the early trade, money flows are negative in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ). Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD ). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV ). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (ASCA:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) is above $100,000. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report is very popular. The protection band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

2024-12-12 15:00:31,AAPL,"Assessing Apple's Performance Against Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$197e754e,BZ,"Amidst the fast-paced and highly competitive business environment of today, conducting comprehensive company analysis is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will delve into an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in comparison to its major competitors within the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing critical financial metrics, market position, and growth potential, our objective is to provide valuable insights for investors and offer a deeper understanding of company's performance in the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 40.54 65.42 9.71 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.35 1.15 0.97 5.72% $1.23 $2.44 9.7% NetApp Inc 22.59 27.96 4.01 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 76.81 2.08 1.63 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 19.06 4.10 1.54 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 158.97 14.40 7.18 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Eastman Kodak Co 9.60 0.55 0.59 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 58.81 3.60 1.08 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 5.07 1.28 1.80 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 18.75 1.29 0.80 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 42.33 6.27 2.18 7.96% $0.34 $0.72 167.32% By carefully studying Apple, we can deduce the following trends: A Price to Earnings ratio of 40.54 significantly below the industry average by 0.96x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth. It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 65.42 which exceeds the industry average by 10.43x . The Price to Sales ratio of 9.71 , which is 4.45x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 15.87% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly below the industry average of 167.32% . This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a financial metric that helps determine the level of financial risk associated with a company's capital structure. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When evaluating Apple alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise: Apple falls in the middle of the list when considering the debt-to-equity ratio. This indicates that the company has a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , suggesting a balanced financial structure with a reasonable debt-equitymix. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest a premium valuation based on book value and sales. In terms of profitability, Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit margins outperform industry peers, reflecting strong operational efficiency. However, the low revenue growth rate may indicate challenges in expanding market share compared to competitors.

2024-12-12 13:38:36,AAPL,!How To Earn $500 A Month From Broadcom Stock Ahead Of Q4 Earnings,BZ$197e4e5e,BZ,"Analysts expect Broadcom Inc . (NASDAQ: AVGO ) to report fourth quarter earnings at $1.39 per share after the closing bell on Thursday, Dec. 12 . That would be up from $1.11 per share in the year-ago period. The Palo Alto, California-based company also projects quarterly revenue of $14.06 billion, compared to $9.29 billion a year earlier. With the recent buzz around Broadcom, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Broadcom offers an annual dividend yield of 1.16%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 53 cents per share ($2.12 a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $518,456 or around 2,830 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $103,691 or around 566 shares. To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($2.12 in this case). So, $6,000 / $2.12 = 2,830 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $2.12 = 566 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. Price Action: Shares of Broadcom gained 6.6% to close at $183.20 on Wednesday following a report indicating the company is working with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) on AI chip development.

2024-12-12 10:40:01,AAPL,Tim Cook Meets PM Keir Starmer Amid Growing Scrutiny Over Apple And Google's Duopoly In UK,BZ$197dbd17,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook On Wednesday met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer . The meeting came at a time when both Apple and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google are facing increased scrutiny in the country. What Happened: Starmer shared a photo on X , formerly Twitter , underscoring the importance of collaboration with businesses to enhance the economy. He praised Apple’s investment in the U.K. and the launch of Apple Intelligence and highlighted the strength of the U.K.’s tech sector. Working in partnership with businesses, we will deliver on our mission to grow the economy and put more money in people's pockets. Good to meet Tim Cook — Apple's investment in the UK and the rollout of Apple Intelligence today is testament to our world leading tech sector. pic.twitter.com/tOs2NXI78z — Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) December 11, 2024 See Also: How To Use Apple Watch As A Digital Key For Your Tesla Car The meeting was part of a broader agenda to boost technology investments, a priority for the Prime Minister. Apple has invested $23 billion (£18 billion) in the U.K. over the past five years, according to Starmer’s spokesperson, reported Reuters prior to the meeting. Cook is also scheduled to meet with King Charles on Thursday to tour Apple’s U.K. headquarters in Battersea, south London. Apple’s U.K. operations have expanded significantly, with engineering teams doubling in size over five years. The company supports approximately 550,000 jobs in the U.K., with investments in Apple TV+ production and key technologies like Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute. Why It Matters: The meeting between Cook and Starmer occurs amid a backdrop of legal and regulatory challenges for Apple in the UK. Last month, a consumer group , Which? , filed a £3 billion ($3.81 billion) legal claim against Apple, accusing the company of breaching U.K. competition law through its iCloud service. The claim suggests that Apple has abused its market dominance by steering customers towards its integrated iCloud service without clearly presenting alternative cloud storage options. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority is also considering an investigation into the mobile browser market, focusing on Apple and Google. This potential probe could further challenge the duopoly’s grip on the market, as the CMA has raised concerns about Apple’s policies potentially hindering innovation by restricting competitors from introducing new features on iPhones. Price Action: Apple's stock fell by 0.52% on Wednesday, ending at $246.49. However, during pre-market trading on Thursday, it gained 0.18%, reaching $246.93. Year-to-date, Apple's shares have risen by 32.78%, slightly surpassing the Nasdaq 100 index's 31.55% gain over the same period, according to Benzinga Pro data . Apple's average price target, based on assessments from 31 analysts, stands at $242.26. Wedbush set the highest target at $300 on Nov. 29. Latest ratings from Needham, Wedbush, and Morgan Stanley suggest an average target of $277.67, indicating a potential upside of 12.45%.

2024-12-12 10:25:46,AAPL,"!Tesla Could Touch $2 Trillion Market Cap By End Of 2025, Says Tech Bull: FSD, Robotaxis, And Cybercab 'Keys' For EV Giant",BZ$197db7c3,BZ,"Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives sees EV giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) achieving a $2 trillion market cap by 2025-end in a bull case scenario. What Happened: “We believe with the autonomous story at Tesla worth $1 trillion alone that in a bull case scenario by the end of 2025, Tesla could achieve a $2 trillion market cap threshold,” Ives said. “FSD, autonomous, and the launch of Cybercab for early 2026 are keys for Tesla."" Wedbush currently has a $400 price target on Tesla with an “outperform” rating. The analyst also said that he believes Musk will play a key role in the U.S.-China tariff negotiations next year. Musk’s involvement, he said, should enable Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia to “get carve-outs in this game of high-stakes poker between DC and Beijing.” Other Predictions: Ives also made eight other projections for the tech sector in 2025, adding that he expects tech mergers and acquisitions to increase by over 50% in terms of public deal-making given that financial buyers and strategic tech players seem interested in fields including software, cyber security, AI infrastructure, and consumer technology. He also expects tech stocks to be up by another 25% in 2025 and for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to join the exclusive $4 trillion market cap club as the “AI revolution” moves into its next gear of growth. Ives is also optimistic about Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR ), which he deems to be the most underappreciated tech name . “We believe 2025 will be another breakout year as its flagship AIP (artificial intelligence platform) product transforms AI use cases within enterprises… with the Messi of AI potentially the next Oracle (Corp),” he said about Palantir. The Wedbush analyst is also positive on iPhone sales and expects Apple to ship more than 240 million iPhones in 2025, breaking previous records.

2024-12-12 09:59:48,AAPL,Microsoft Brings iPhone File Sharing To Windows PCs With New Phone Link Update: Here's What You Need To Know,BZ$197dade5,BZ,"On Wednesday, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) made a significant stride in bridging the gap between Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones and Windows PCs with its latest Phone Link update.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) — smashed through record highs during Wednesday trading, solidifying their grip on the global stock market and fueling another strong rally in 2024. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NYSE: MAGS ), a closely watched benchmark for the group's market performance, surged 2.8% on Wednesday, setting a new all-time high. Notably, Tesla shares soared to fresh all-time highs after surpassing the peak set in November 202. The EV-maker has gained 67% since the U.S. presidential election, thanks to its innovative ability to scale like a software company. “Because Tesla can remotely update its fleet’s software, its ability to scale and grow are more similar to the other tech companies in the Magnificent-7 than an auto manufacturer,” said Wall Street veteran investor Ed Yardeni in a note Wednesday. Alphabet led the day's rally with a 4.63% gain, while Apple lagged, showing a flat performance. The elite group of tech giants has delivered an average return of 67.1% year-to-date, compared to a record-breaking 111.7% average return in 2023. Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) were the only members of the elite group that did not hit new all-time highs during Wednesday's trading session. Yet, Nvidia remains the standout performer with a staggering year-to-date gain of 182%, securing its position as the top performer in the Magnificent Seven.

2024-12-11 15:00:28,AAPL,"Insights Into Apple's Performance Versus Peers In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Sector",BZ$197b4cd7,BZ,"In today's rapidly changing and highly competitive business world, it is vital for investors and industry enthusiasts to carefully assess companies. In this article, we will perform a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) against its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing important financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 40.75 65.76 9.76 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.36 1.15 0.97 5.72% $1.23 $2.44 9.7% NetApp Inc 22.32 27.63 3.96 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 75.63 2.04 1.60 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 20.18 4.34 1.63 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 154.59 14.01 6.98 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Eastman Kodak Co 9.51 0.55 0.58 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 58.84 3.60 1.08 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 5.06 1.27 1.80 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 19.57 1.35 0.83 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 41.9 6.22 2.16 7.96% $0.34 $0.72 167.32% When conducting a detailed analysis of Apple, the following trends become clear: The stock's Price to Earnings ratio of 40.75 is lower than the industry average by 0.97x , suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants. It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 65.76 which exceeds the industry average by 10.57x . The Price to Sales ratio of 9.76 , which is 4.52x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 15.87% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 167.32% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio indicates the proportion of debt and equity used by a company to finance its assets and operations. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. In terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple stands in comparison with its top 4 peers, leading to the following comparisons: When evaluating the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple is in the middle position among its top 4 peers. The company maintains a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , suggesting a relatively balanced financial structure. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, but may be facing challenges in revenue expansion.

2024-12-11 13:20:12,AAPL,!Taiwan Semi Founder Calls For New Strategy After Intel Chief's Departure,BZ$197b1f08,BZ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE: TSM ) founder Morris Chang told Reuters Monday that Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC ) should have focused on developing its artificial intelligence moat instead of contract chipmaking. Chang’s comments followed Intel chief Pat Gelsinger’s departure after he failed to impress the board with his turnaround efforts. Intel stock has plunged 58% year-to-date. Also Read: Trump’s Return Threatens Billions in US Chip Investment from Taiwan, Samsung During Chang’s autobiography launch event, he emphasized the need for a new strategy and CEO for Intel. In November, Chang released his biography, which included Taiwan Semiconductor’s deals with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and how Intel abandoned an invitation to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor in the 1980s before becoming a key customer. Gelsinger’s turnaround efforts involved making the fastest and most minor computer chips for other companies, but Taiwan Semiconductor eventually overtook this advantage. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 89% year-to-date. Chang said Intel lost or canceled contracts with major clients while aiming for ambitious manufacturing and AI capabilities. On Tuesday, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Intel’s credit rating to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB+ citing weak business recovery and uncertainty following Gelsinger’s exit. However, the firm expects Intel’s client computing segment to post growth after a modest recovery in 2025 backed by the PC refresh cycle and its Data Center and AI (DCAI) and Networking and Edge segments. Meanwhile, Intel tapped semiconductor veterans Eric Meurice of ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ: ASML ) and Steve Sanghi of Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MCHP ) to its board. Intel has narrowed its eligible CEO list to include former director Lip-Bu Tan. William Stein of Truist Securities and Cody Acree of Benchmark recommended selling the entire Intel company or parts of it, including splitting the manufacturing and products businesses and downsizing. They also noted that Intel’s current focus on separating its Products and Foundry businesses could mean forfeiting the $7.8 billion in U.S. chip subsidy. Intel interim co-CEO David Zinsner expects the next CEO to be equipped with manufacturing and product skills. Investors can gain exposure to Intel through First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: FTXL ) and REX FANG & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: FEPI ).

2024-12-11 12:38:44,AAPL,"A Tech Renaissance Could Offer Enticing Opportunities In Direxion's QQQU, QQQD ETFs",BZ$197b05f2,BZ,"Late last month, JPMorgan analysts stated that with other global regions struggling with various challenges, the U.S. will likely remain the global growth leader . Much of this bold assertion centers on artificial intelligence. As Benzinga recently reported, AI ""is sparking a capital expenditure boom that dwarfs anything seen in decades."" Specifically, the companies that comprise the Magnificent 7 – Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) – plan to invest over $500 billion in capital expenditures and research and development next year. If so, the collective investments will represent roughly 25% of these tech juggernauts' combined sales. Furthermore, JPMorgan estimates that the wider AI landscape could see total spending breach the $1 trillion mark by the end of the year. This tally includes costs for infrastructure, engineering specialists and data center management. In addition, the individual names that make up the ranks of the Magnificent 7 have been commanding the spotlight. Earlier this week, Google Quantum AI founder and head Hartmut Neven revealed its latest quantum chip called Willow. Hailed as a major leap in computing technology, Willow can deliver blistering performance while exponentially reducing errors. On the automotive front, German automaker BMW (OTC: BMWYY ) remarked on social media that Tesla's latest version of its full self-driving (FSD) driver assistance software was ""very impressive."" Critically, Gary Black , Managing Partner at The Future Fund , noted the possibility that the electric vehicle manufacturer may license out its FSD tech to another automaker, echoing the sentiments of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The Direxion ETFs: Nevertheless, JPMorgan analysts warned that not everything about the Magnificent 7 is without concern. Notably, the experts stated that capital misallocation and lofty growth targets could invite investor skepticism by late next year. If so, the ability to extract returns from both positive and negative narratives forms the backbone of Direxion's innovation-focused exchange-traded funds. The bulls may be attracted to the Direxion Daily Magnificent 7 Bull 2X Shares (NYSE: QQQU ). Anchored heaviest to Tesla, QQQU seeks to deliver 200% of the performance of the Indxx Magnificent 7 Index. On the other end, bears may consider the Direxion Daily Magnificent 7 Bear 1X Shares (NYSE: QQQD ), which seeks 100% of the inverse performance of the aforementioned index. Fundamentally, the QQQU and QQQD offer convenient mechanisms for speculation. For one thing, tech's heavy hitters can be found under one roof. Second, investors can enjoy either leverage or a short position without resorting to options and their inherent complexities. However, it's important to note that Direxion urges investors to not hold a position in either ETF for a period longer than one day. Doing so may result in value erosion due to the daily compounding of volatility. The QQQU ETF: As expected, the QQQU 2x bull fund has been on a blistering ride since its market debut in March of this year, gaining 87%. At the moment, the leveraged ETF stands firmly above its 20-day exponential and 50-day (simple) moving averages, suggesting sustained momentum. Despite recent strong volume, QQQU printed a candlestick reminiscent of a ""shooting star,"" which may suggest temporary overextension. The QQQD ETF: On the other side of the tracks, the QQQD ETF has incurred a rough outing since its March debut, losing approximately 31% of its value. In a complete flipping of sentiment, the inverse fund sits well below its 20-day exponential moving average and 50 DMA, posing significant concerns. However, the bear ETF also appears to have printed a ""hammer"" candlestick, which possibly suggests a temporary reprieve in the downward trend. Featured photo by Kohji Asakawa on Pixabay .

When looking for information on top news stories, many people around the world turned to Google, the search engine owned by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), where they searched for athletes, celebrities, politicians and coverage of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Here’s a look at the top 10 most searched-for items worldwide on Google in 2024 : Copa América UEFA European Championship ICC Men's T20 World Cup India vs England Liam Payne Donald Trump India vs Bangladesh iPhone 16 Olympics Catherine, Princess of Wales In the United States, the top 10 most searched items were: Election Donald Trump Connections New York Yankees Kamala Harris Copa America Hurricane Milton tracker Olympics medal count Toby Keith Liam Payne Here are the top 10 most searched news items worldwide in 2024: U.S. Election Excessive heat Olympics Hurricane Milton Typhoon No. 10 Iran Rafah CrowdStrike Trump shot Menendez brothers Monkeypox Several sporting events dominated the worldwide searches in 2024, with soccer and cricket events being the top searched items. The Copa América was hosted by the United States, which likely led to increased American interest in the event, which featured North American and South American soccer teams. The United States men's soccer team failed to advance past the group stage with Argentina winning the championship. The Men's T20 World Cup was co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States in June 2024. The event was the first major ICC tournament to have matches played in the United States. On the business side of things, the iPhone 16 from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was the eighth most-searched item in 2024, a signal of global demand for the smartphone. CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD ), which suffered a large IT outage was one of the most-searched news items in 2024. Several Olympic athletes and themes were among the most-searched items in 2024 globally and in the United States. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) had the media rights to the Olympics in the United States. The Menendez brothers also saw strong interest among news searches, which may have been helped by a Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) true crime documentary film that put their case back into the national and global spotlight.

2024-12-10 15:00:28,AAPL,"Competitor Analysis: Evaluating Apple And Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$197817e7,BZ,"In the ever-evolving and intensely competitive business landscape, conducting a thorough company analysis is of utmost importance for investors and industry followers. In this article, we will carry out an in-depth industry comparison, assessing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) alongside its primary competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By meticulously examining key financial metrics, market positioning, and growth prospects, we aim to offer valuable insights to investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 40.58 65.49 9.72 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.97 1.21 1.03 5.72% $1.23 $2.44 9.7% NetApp Inc 23.50 29.08 4.17 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Super Micro Computer Inc 21.98 4.73 1.78 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Western Digital Corp 77.74 2.10 1.65 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 163.62 14.82 7.39 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Eastman Kodak Co 9.70 0.56 0.59 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 58.74 3.59 1.08 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 5.01 1.26 1.78 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 20.17 1.39 0.86 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 43.6 6.53 2.26 7.96% $0.34 $0.72 167.32% By carefully studying Apple, we can deduce the following trends: At 40.58 , the stock's Price to Earnings ratio is 0.93x less than the industry average, suggesting favorable growth potential. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 65.49 relative to the industry average by 10.03x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.72 , surpassing the industry average by 4.3x , may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% that is 15.87% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. With higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly below the industry average of 167.32% . This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a financial metric that helps determine the level of financial risk associated with a company's capital structure. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When assessing Apple against its top 4 peers using the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following comparisons can be made: Apple falls in the middle of the list when considering the debt-to-equity ratio. This indicates that the company has a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , suggesting a balanced financial structure with a reasonable debt-equitymix. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, despite slower revenue growth. Overall, Apple's financial performance is solid, with room for potential growth in the future. This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.

2024-12-10 14:10:15,AAPL,!Taiwan Semi November Revenue Ups 34% Strengthened by AI and Smartphone Demand,BZ$197800f9,BZ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE: TSM ) reported a topline growth of 34% year-on-year to $8.55 billion in November 2024 . Revenue for January through November 2024 grew by 31.8% year over year to $81.05 billion, testimony to the continued artificial intelligence frenzy. The contract chipmaker’s market share grew to 64.9%, up from 62.3% Q/Q, helping it retain the top position in the global wafer foundry business. This is due to the smartphone and AI-related demand for its 3nm and 5nm technologies thanks to clients like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Also Read: Google Quantum AI’s New Willow Chip Can Do in Minutes That Supercomputers Would Take 10 Septillion Years Taiwan Semiconductor’s performance reflects the chipmaker’s production capacity utilization and wafer shipment boost. Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics (OTC: SSNLF ) bore the brunt of competition from Chinese rivals for advanced technology, with its market share falling to 9.3% in the quarter, down from 11.5% Q/Q. Taiwan Semiconductor stock is up over 96% year-to-date. The chipmaker is extending its footprint beyond Taiwan to help countries develop their semiconductor moat instead of depending solely on China. Recent reports indicated Nvidia is exploring the production of the Blackwell AI chips at Taiwan Semiconductor’s Arizona plant. Apple and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD ) are already customers of Arizona’s Taiwan Semiconductor chip plant. The chipmaker has manufactured Nvidia’s Blackwell chips in its Taiwan facilities, where its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity exists. Taiwan Semiconductor has maintained its key advanced technology production facilities in Taiwan, which renders it vulnerable to geopolitical risks.

2024-12-10 10:45:51,AAPL,Google-Meta Under Fire: EU Watchdog Reportedly Probes Alleged Secret Ad Deal Targeting Teen Users,BZ$19779217,BZ,"European regulators have launched an investigation into a clandestine advertising arrangement between Google in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) that reportedly circumvented Google’s own advertising policies for minors. What Happened : The European Commission is delving into advertising campaigns that promoted Instagram to teenagers on YouTube. In October, regulators requested Alphabet, Google’s parent company, to provide data, presentations, and internal communications related to these campaigns, according to sources familiar with the matter. This inquiry follows a Financial Times report on Tuesday, which highlighted the controversial partnership. The investigation, internally dubbed “Tangerine Owl,” uncovered that Google employees had advised Meta on how to bypass Google’s ad policies for minors. Despite Google’s prohibition on ad personalization for teenagers, the campaign targeted users categorized as “unknown,” a group predominantly comprising individuals under 18. After a Financial Times investigation in August, Google has strengthened its policies, prohibiting demographic targeting of the “unknown” group and mandating staff to acknowledge their responsibilities. The campaign, initially piloted in Canada and later expanded to the US, was eventually terminated. See Also: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Risks Breaking Down The ‘Magic Money Creation Machine’ With His Growing Bitcoin Bet, Says Expert Both Google and Meta continue to face increasing scrutiny from regulators and politicians, with ongoing investigations and legal challenges in both the US and Europe. Why It Matters : The investigation into Google and Meta’s advertising practices comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny over tech giants’ handling of user data and advertising practices. In August, allegations surfaced that Google and Meta secretly targeted Instagram ads to teenagers on YouTube, violating Google’s own policies regarding minors. The campaign reportedly targeted a user group labeled as “unknown,” which Google knew was predominantly under-18s. In a related development, Google recently won an appeal against a €1.49 billion ($1.66 billion) antitrust fine imposed by the European Commission for anticompetitive practices in its online search advertising business. The Luxembourg-based General Court nullified the penalty, providing a reprieve to Google. This backdrop of legal challenges underscores the ongoing tension between tech giants and regulatory bodies in Europe. Read Next: Happy Birthday Dogecoin!

The contract chipmaker’s market share grew to 64.9% (up from 62.3% in the second quarter) ahead of Samsung Electronics Co (OTC: SSNLF ) as flagship smartphone products and high-performance computing (HPC) devices gain traction, the Taipei Times cites from TrendForce report.

Note the following: In Syria, the regime of Bashar al-Assad has fallen after a lightning fast advance by rebels over 11 days. Bashar al-Assad's father Hafez al-Assad seized power in a military coup in November 1970. In a stunning development, the 54-year al-Assad rule of Syria has ended. Bashar al-Assad has been granted asylum in Russia. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's (HTS), the rebel group that captured Syria's capital Damascus, origin goes back to al-Qaeda. This group was essentially the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda. HTS is trying to rebrand itself with assurance to minorities and has so far, not engaged in violence. However, in The Arora Report analysis, prudent investors should be aware that this is a rigid Islamist group that had once vowed to impose Sharia law. In The Arora Report analysis, there is a power vacuum in Syria. The danger is the establishment of an Islamic caliphate. In The Arora Report analysis, the biggest winner from the situation in Syria is Turkey. The chart shows stocks in Turkey are up. Foreign money is flowing into Turkish stocks this morning. The chart shows that Turkey ETF TUR is now at the top band of the resistance zone. As clarity develops, there may be an opportunity in Turkey. The Arora Report’s ZYX Emerging has continuously followed Turkey for 17 years. Turkey is a member of NATO, but is also closely aligned with Russia. Turkey has also been a big supporter of Hamas in Gaza. The U.S. relationship with Turkey lately has been tense. Now, Turkey will have more leverage against both the U.S. and Russia. The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria. The U.S. is conducting airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria to prevent ISIS from gaining power. Yesterday, the U.S. conducted 75 airstrikes in Syria. The biggest losers are Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah. Russia has a naval base and an air base in Syria. The Russian naval base in Syria is Russia's only warm water naval base. Due to the prospects of instability, investors are buying gold, silver, and oil. Investors are selling bitcoin and other cryptos. This again shows that bitcoin and cryptos are not a hedge against global instability. In The Arora Report analysis, China is gearing up to fight Trump's potential tariffs. China has picked NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) as the first target. As a result, NVDA stock is seeing selling. China is promising stimulative monetary policy. Stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai are jumping. Foreign money is flowing into China. More inflation data is coming this week. Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released on Wednesday at 8:30am ET, and Producer Price Index (PPI) will be released on Thursday at 8:30am ET. This data may be market moving. Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are positive in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ). In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ). In the early trade, money flows are negative in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG ), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ). In the early trade, money flows are neutral in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ). Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD ). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV ). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (ASCA:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) is under $100K and seeing selling on Syria developments. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report is very popular. The protection band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

2024-12-09 15:01:52,AAPL,"Understanding Apple's Position In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry Compared To Competitors",BZ$1974cb25,BZ,"In the dynamic and fiercely competitive business environment, conducting a thorough analysis of companies is crucial for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will perform an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in relation to its major competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By closely examining crucial financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to offer valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 39.94 64.46 9.57 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 12.41 1.25 1.06 5.72% $1.23 $2.44 9.7% NetApp Inc 24.15 29.88 4.28 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Super Micro Computer Inc 21.87 4.70 1.77 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Western Digital Corp 78.10 2.11 1.66 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 166.46 15.08 7.51 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Eastman Kodak Co 10.16 0.58 0.62 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 59.87 3.66 1.10 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 4.82 1.21 1.71 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 18.94 1.30 0.80 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 44.09 6.64 2.28 7.96% $0.34 $0.72 167.32% When closely examining Apple, the following trends emerge: A Price to Earnings ratio of 39.94 significantly below the industry average by 0.91x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 64.46 relative to the industry average by 9.71x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.57 , surpassing the industry average by 4.2x , may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% that is 15.87% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 6.07% compared to the industry average of 167.32% , which indicates a challenging sales environment. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio gauges the extent to which a company has financed its operations through debt relative to equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By evaluating Apple against its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following observations arise: When compared to its top 4 peers, Apple has a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . This implies that the company maintains a balanced financial structure with a reasonable level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The PB and PS ratios are high, suggesting overvaluation relative to industry standards. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit signify strong profitability, while the low revenue growth implies slower expansion compared to industry peers.

2024-12-09 09:07:00,AAPL,"Apple Expands Retail Footprint In Saudi Arabia With Online Store Launch, Plans Multiple Flagship Locations",BZ$19741cb4,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) announced expansion plans in Saudi Arabia, marking a significant step in its Middle East growth strategy. The tech giant will launch its first Arabic-language online store in the summer of 2025, followed by multiple flagship retail locations starting in 2026, according to a company announcement Sunday. What Happened : CEO Tim Cook highlighted plans for an iconic store in Diriyah, a UNESCO World Heritage site. “We’re excited to be expanding here in Saudi Arabia,” Cook said, emphasizing the company’s commitment to deepening customer connections in the region. The expansion builds on Apple’s existing Saudi presence, including its women-only Developer Academy in Riyadh, launched in 2021 in partnership with the Saudi government and Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University. Nearly 2,000 students have completed the academy’s programming courses. Why It Matters: The Saudi iOS app economy has shown remarkable growth, with developer earnings surging over 1,750% since 2019. Apple’s investment in the kingdom exceeds 10 billion Saudi Riyals ($2.66 billion) over the past five years. Recent developments include Riyadh becoming the first Middle Eastern city to implement Apple Pay’s Express Mode for metro transit, joining over 250 global cities with Apple Pay transit integration. Price Action : Apple stock closed at $242.84, down 0.08% on Friday. Year-to-date, the stock has surged by 30.81%. According to data from Benzinga Pro , Apple’s consensus price target is $242.26 from 31 analysts, ranging from a high of $300 to a low of $180. Recent ratings from Wedbush, Morgan Stanley, and Maxim Group average $262.67, indicating an 8.40% potential upside.

2024-12-09 02:10:59,AAPL,"Apple Faces $1.2B Lawsuit Over Child Sexual Abuse Material Detection On iCloud &#x2014; Tech Giant Says, 'Urgently  And Actively Innovating'",BZ$1973b099,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is facing a $1.2 billion lawsuit filed on Saturday in U.S. District Court in Northern California for discontinuing its child sexual abuse material detection feature . What Happened: The plaintiff, a 27-year-old woman using a pseudonym, alleges that Apple broke its promise to protect victims like her, reported The New York Times. She claims that images of her abuse were stored on iCloud , and Apple’s decision allowed the material to be widely shared. The lawsuit seeks changes to Apple’s practices and compensation for up to 2,680 victims. Unlike competitors such as Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google and Meta Platforsm, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: META ) Facebook , Apple has historically reported far fewer instances of abusive material, citing its commitment to user privacy. See Also: Intel Stock Is Where It Was 27 Years Ago: How The World’s Leading Chipmaker Lost The Plot, Thrice However, child safety advocates have criticized the company for failing to take stronger action to curb the spread of such content. In a related case in August, a nine-year-old victim’s attorneys sued Apple in North Carolina, alleging strangers sent her CSAM via iCloud. Apple has filed a motion to dismiss, citing Section 230 protections. However, recent court rulings may challenge Apple’s defense. Apple spokesman Fred Sainz stated the company is committed to combating child sexual abuse material while maintaining user privacy. ""We are urgently and actively innovating to combat these crimes without compromising the security and privacy of all our users."" Apple did not immediately respond to Benzinga’s request for comments. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: The lawsuit stems from Apple’s decision in 2022 to abandon a plan to scan iCloud images for CSAM. Initially announced in 2021, the plan aimed to detect CSAM using a hashtag system on devices. In September last year, Apple explained its decision to abandon CSAM detection plans, citing privacy concerns and potential unintended consequences. Earlier this year in January, tech leaders including Mark Zuckerberg and others testified at a Senate hearing on child safety, showing a growing industry focus on this issue. Meanwhile, Apple is facing other legal challenges, such as a lawsuit from an employee alleging privacy violations . In October, Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $94.56 billion. Price Action: Apple’s stock dipped 0.082% on Friday, closing at $242.84, with an additional 0.22% drop in after-hours trading, bringing it to $242.30. Year-to-date, Apple shares have risen 30.81%, narrowly outpacing the Nasdaq 100 index's 30.7% gain during the same timeframe, as per Benzinga Pro data . Apple’s consensus price target, derived from evaluations by 31 analysts, is $242.26, with the highest target of $300 set by Wedbush on Nov. 29. Recent ratings from Wedbush, Morgan Stanley, and Maxim Group average $262.67, suggesting a potential upside of 8.4%. Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link .

2024-12-08 21:38:09,AAPL,Apple Eyes Sony Partnership For Game-Changing Vision Pro Upgrade,BZ$19739527,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE ) are reportedly joining hands to augment the gaming capabilities of the Vision Pro . Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman in his latest weekly “Power On” newsletter has said the enhancement will come through the addition of support for Sony’s PSVR2 controllers. Gurman has said that the partnership was initially scheduled to be announced weeks prior but “will still come at some point — unless it gets abruptly scrapped.” The collaboration entails Apple commencing the sale of Sony’s controllers, which are currently not available for individual purchase. Gurman believes this move could be a game-changer for Vision Pro users who are looking for an elevated gaming experience. Sony has been diligently working on this support for several months, while Apple has been engaging with third-party developers to gauge their interest in using Sony’s VR controllers. Apple approached Sony earlier this year, and the duo agreed to work together on launching support for the PlayStation VR2's hand controllers on the Vision Pro. Inside Sony, the work has been a monthslong undertaking, I'm told. And Apple has discussed the plan with third-party… — Mark Gurman (@markgurman) December 8, 2024 Also Read: Apple Eyes Meta For Potentially Game-Changing AI Partnership: Report Gurman hints that Apple’s plans for the controllers extend beyond gaming. The controllers could be utilized to navigate visionOS and offer more accurate controls in applications such as Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop. Despite potential concerns raised by the Vision Pro’s sales figures and Apple’s past relationships with game publishers, the unique nature of VR and the evident demand from the community suggest a promising future for this collaboration. According to him, the partnership between Apple and Sony marks a significant step in the evolution of gaming on the Vision Pro. By integrating Sony’s PSVR2 controllers, Apple is not only enhancing the gaming experience but also expanding the functionality of the controllers to navigate its operating system and applications. This move could potentially attract more third-party developers to the platform, further enriching the ecosystem. The collaboration also indicates a shift in Apple’s approach towards gaming, hinting at a more inclusive and immersive gaming experience for its users.

2024-12-07 19:30:14,AAPL,"!OpenAI's ChatGPT Makes Headway In Search, Threatening Google's Reign",BZ$19732ba4,BZ,"OpenAI ‘s chatbot, ChatGPT , is gaining traction in the online search market, potentially challenging Google ‘s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) long-established supremacy . What Happened : A survey conducted by brokerage firm Evercore ISI disclosed that ChatGPT was the favored search provider for 5% of 1,000 respondents, a significant increase from 1% in June. Millennials were identified as the primary drivers of this uptake. Despite the rise, Google still commands the majority of the search market, with 78% of respondents choosing it as their first preference, a slight decrease from 80% in June. Nonetheless, even a minor shift in market share is noteworthy in the online search industry, which is the foundation of Google’s ad business. According to the survey, ChatGPT’s modest gains suggest a potential shift in Google’s status as the internet’s main gatekeeper. OpenAI’s generative AI technology is revolutionizing how millions access digital information, sparking debates about the sustainability of Google’s search dominance. Also Read: Whistleblowers Accuse OpenAI Of Hindering Staff From Reporting AI Risks In October, OpenAI rolled out a full search feature for ChatGPT and also secured a partnership with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), placing ChatGPT prominently on numerous iPhones. Both moves are perceived as direct challenges to Google. Despite these advancements, Google remains significantly ahead, as indicated by positive results from Evercore’s survey. Google’s Gemini , a ChatGPT-like assistant, and AI Overviews, a feature that summarizes search results, were deemed more effective by 71% of Google users. Why It Matters : The rise of ChatGPT signifies a potential shift in the online search landscape. Google’s dominance has been unchallenged for years, but OpenAI’s advancements suggest a new competitor is emerging. The partnership with Apple and the introduction of a full search feature for ChatGPT are strategic moves to increase its market share. However, it remains to be seen if ChatGPT can monetize search queries as effectively as Google, a factor critical to its success.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is reportedly working on its modem technology. This could result in slimmer iPhones and introduce cellular capabilities to Macs and headsets like Vision Pro. What Happened: Apple is developing a new modem, internally named Sinope, which is set to debut next year, reported Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. This modem will gradually replace components from Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) over three years. Apple engineers have expressed concerns about Qualcomm’s modems taking up too much space in iPhones, the report noted. See Also: Apple Might Have To Commit $1 Billion To Indonesia To Reverse iPhone 16 Ban The first device to feature the new modem will be the iPhone SE, launching next year. It will be followed by Apple’s thinnest phone yet, codenamed D23, later in 2025. This transition paves the way for Apple to explore foldable devices and introduce cellular connectivity to Macs by 2026. As per the report, Apple is also considering adding cellular support to headsets. The first modem will also appear in low-end iPads next year, with a 2026 update planned for Pro versions of the iPhone and iPad.

2024-12-06 15:34:37,AAPL,Chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Should See Business Grow 20% Fueled By AI Demand: Analyst,BZ$1970f9b3,BZ,"SinoPac Financial Holdings chief economist Jack Huang expects chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE: TSM ) to grow its business by 20% in 2025. What Happened : Huang said Wednesday that Taiwan Semiconductor could also be pivotal to an expected Taiex rally in the first half of 2025. Taiex is the benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). Taiwan Semiconductor will continue to capitalize on the demand frenzy for electronics used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, leading to the surge in the Taiwanese stock index. Also Read: Intel’s New CEO Change Unlikely To Help Gain Traction Versus Taiwan Semi And Nvidia: Analysts Huang told the Taipei Times that he expects a 2025 GDP growth of 2.96% for Taiwan, factoring in global economic uncertainties as US President-elect Donald Trump takes charge and implements the tariffs. Sharon Lin of SinoPac Securities shares a similar sentiment, expecting tariffs to fuel inflation and dampen the chances of a US Fed rate cut in 2025. SinoPac Financial expects the US dollar to hold up despite Trump’s protectionist practices, which are a tailwind for export-oriented economies, including Taiwan. Reportedly, Taiwan Semiconductor accounts for 36% of Taiwan's index weighting . Recent reports indicated Taiwan Semiconductor is considering producing the front-end process of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Blackwell AI chips at the contract chipmaker’s Arizona plant. Taiwan Semiconductor’s current Arizona plant customers include Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD ).

2024-12-06 15:00:31,AAPL,"Industry Comparison: Evaluating Apple Against Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$1970e1a8,BZ,"In today's rapidly changing and highly competitive business world, it is imperative for investors and industry observers to carefully assess companies before making investment choices. In this article, we will undertake a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) vis-à-vis its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. Through a detailed analysis of important financial indicators, market standing, and growth potential, our goal is to provide valuable insights and highlight company's performance in the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 39.97 64.51 9.58 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.22 1.13 0.96 2.34% $1.23 $2.44 10.11% NetApp Inc 23.72 29.35 4.21 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 79.24 2.14 1.68 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 20.48 4.40 1.66 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 160.41 14.53 7.24 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Eastman Kodak Co 9.77 0.56 0.60 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 58.06 3.55 1.07 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 5.01 1.26 1.78 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 18.77 1.29 0.80 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 42.96 6.47 2.22 7.59% $0.34 $0.72 167.37% By analyzing Apple, we can infer the following trends: With a Price to Earnings ratio of 39.97 , which is 0.93x less than the industry average, the stock shows potential for growth at a reasonable price, making it an interesting consideration for market participants. With a Price to Book ratio of 64.51 , which is 9.97x the industry average, Apple might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers. The Price to Sales ratio of 9.58 , which is 4.32x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.24% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. With higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 6.07% compared to the industry average of 167.37% , which indicates a challenging sales environment. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio gauges the extent to which a company has financed its operations through debt relative to equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. In terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple stands in comparison with its top 4 peers, leading to the following comparisons: As Apple is in the middle of the list in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, it suggests that the company has a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 compared to the other companies. This position indicates a relatively balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a reasonable level of debt while also leveraging equity for financing its operations. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The PB and PS ratios are high, suggesting overvaluation relative to industry standards.

2024-12-06 05:11:21,AAPL,Amazon Halts Inferentia AI Chip Development To Take On Nvidia: How Trainium Is Shaping Up To Be The New Weapon In AI Chip Wars,BZ$196fce37,BZ,"Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has decided to halt the development of its Inferentia AI chip, shifting its focus to the Trainium chip. What Happened: This decision is part of Amazon’s broader strategy to enhance cost performance in AI model training, reported Nikkei on Thursday. Since it entered the AI chip market in 2018, Amazon Web Services has been offering both Inferentia and Trainium chips to AI companies. See Also: Trump’s AI Czar Plans, Alibaba’s New Model, Cathie Wood On Tesla AI, And Musk’s Combat Transformation: This Week In Artificial Intelligence However, Rahul Kulkarni , AWS’s director of compute, announced that the product lines will merge, with a focus on Trainium for both inference and training tasks. Trainium is designed with a larger memory capacity and supports diverse data formats, enabling rapid computations across multiple servers. ""We can get to the same level of optimization and cost performance benefits by doubling down on Trainium as a single, unified product,"" Kulkarni stated. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: During a tech event in Las Vegas , Amazon unveiled the Trainium2 chip and announced plans for the Trainium3 chip, expected in 2025. The Trainium3 will use a 3-nanometer chipmaking process, doubling Trainium2’s computing performance. With this, Amazon aims to challenge Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which holds a 90% share in the AI chip market. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and AI startup Anthropic are among those adopting Trainium2 for AI development. In October, Amazon reported third-quarter net sales of $158.9 billion, marking an 11% increase compared to the previous year. This performance surpassed the Street’s consensus forecast of $157.2 billion, as per data from Benzinga Pro . Price Action: Amazon's stock rose by 1.1% on Thursday, finishing at $220.55. In the after-hours session, it saw a dip of 0.1%, reaching $220.32. So far this year, Amazon shares have surged by 47.1%, significantly outperforming the Nasdaq 100 index, which gained 29.5% over the same period. Amazon has a consensus price target of $238.16 from 38 analysts, with JMP Securities setting the highest target at $285 on Nov. 1. Latest ratings from Needham, BMO Capital, and MoffettNathanson indicate an average target of $244.67, implying an upside potential of 11.05%.

2024-12-06 02:15:31,AAPL,"Tim Cook Explains Why Apple Defied Steve Jobs' Design Philosophy With the iPhone 16's Camera Button, Touches On Retirement Plans: 'I'll Do It Until&#x2026;'",BZ$196f73c7,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook has shared insights on the company’s future, touching on the iPhone 16’s new camera button, Vision Pro sales, and AirPods’ evolution. What Happened: In an interview with WIRED published on Wednesday, Cook was asked about the decision to add a physical button to the iPhone 16 for camera control—a stark departure from Steve Jobs' aversion to buttons. Cook replied, ""I don't know what Steve would have thought,"" but believed the change was essential for improving user experience. On generative AI, Cook described it as ""a wave"" that grew over time. He noted Apple's foresight in incorporating a neural engine into its products back in 2017, recognizing early that AI and machine learning would revolutionize technology. See Also: Jeff Bezos’ Amazon Unveils Powerful AI Chip Clusters To Supercharge Anthropic’s Models, Challenging Nvidia And OpenAI’s Dominance The Apple CEO also addressed reports of slower-than-expected Vision Pro sales, describing it as a product for early adopters. ""The ultimate test for us is the ecosystem."" Regarding AirPods' future role in addressing hearing loss, Cook framed it as a democratization of health. The tech giant aims to reduce the stigma of traditional hearing aids and encourage self-diagnosis. When asked about his tenure as CEO, Cook admitted he hasn't set a firm timeline for his departure. ""I'll do it until the voice in my head says, ‘It's time,'"" he said. ""But it's hard to imagine life without Apple."" Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: Earlier this week, speculations rose about Cook’s potential retirement and the search for his successor. At 63, his tenure has surpassed that of many Fortune 500 CEOs. Last month, Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, surpassing analysts’ projections of $94.56 billion. The tech giant also reported adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share for the quarter, exceeding the anticipated $1.60 per share. Price Action: Apple’s stock gained 0.021% on Thursday, closing at $243.04, before slipping 0.045% in after-hours trading to $242.93. Year-to-date, Apple shares have risen 30.92%, outpacing the Nasdaq 100 index, which has increased by 29.50% during the same timeframe, according to data from Benzinga Pro . Apple’s consensus price target, based on assessments from 31 analysts, stands at $242.26, with the highest target of $300 issued by Wedbush on Nov. 29. Latest ratings from Wedbush, Morgan Stanley, and Maxim Group average $262.67, indicating a potential upside of 8.12%.

2024-12-05 15:00:27,AAPL,"Investigating Apple's Standing In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry Compared To Competitors",BZ$196e1ec7,BZ,"In the ever-changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, conducting thorough company analysis is crucial for investors and industry experts. In this article, we will undertake a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and its primary competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By closely examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, our aim is to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 39.97 64.50 9.58 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 15.43 1.28 0.99 2.34% $1.23 $2.44 10.11% NetApp Inc 23.77 29.41 4.22 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 79.49 2.15 1.69 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 20.81 4.48 1.68 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 167.56 15.18 7.56 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Eastman Kodak Co 9.94 0.57 0.61 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 59.03 3.61 1.09 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 5.06 1.27 1.80 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 18.61 1.28 0.79 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 44.41 6.58 2.27 7.59% $0.34 $0.72 167.37% Through a meticulous analysis of Apple, we can observe the following trends: A Price to Earnings ratio of 39.97 significantly below the industry average by 0.9x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth. It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 64.5 which exceeds the industry average by 9.8x . The Price to Sales ratio of 9.58 , which is 4.22x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% , which is 16.24% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential. With higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 167.37% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio indicates the proportion of debt and equity used by a company to finance its assets and operations. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By analyzing Apple in relation to its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be derived: Compared to its top 4 peers, Apple has a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , indicating a balanced financial structure. This suggests that the company maintains a reasonable level of debt while also leveraging equity financing. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales highly. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability, while the low revenue growth implies slower expansion compared to industry peers.

2024-12-05 12:49:42,AAPL,"!Nvidia Could Become Taiwan Semi's Third US Plant Customer, But With A Catch",BZ$196dd123,BZ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE: TSM ) and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) are exploring production of the front-end process of Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the former Arizona plant, Reuters cites familiar sources. Taiwan Semiconductor has so far manufactured Nvidia's Blackwell chips in its Taiwan facilities, where its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity exists. Also Read: ZJK Industrial Surges On Nvidia Liquid Cooling Collaboration (UPDATED) Therefore, it must ship the Blackwell chips back to Taiwan for packaging, which renders Nvidia vulnerable to U.S. geopolitical tensions with China. For context, China continued threats and military exercises around Taiwan . Meanwhile, most of Taiwan Semiconductor's production capacity is based in Taiwan. The key Nvidia supplier targets mass production of the Blackwell chips in early 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor's current Arizona plant customers reportedly include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD ). Earlier this week, Amazon.Com Inc's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) cloud unit claimed that it could connect more chips than Nvidia and could train some AI models at a 40% discount to Nvidia chips. Amazon Web Services showcased its data center servers embedded with its AI chips, dubbed Trn2 UltraServers. These servers target Nvidia's flagship server, which is packed with the latest Blackwell chips. Amazon also disclosed that it is building artificial intelligence supercomputers in collaboration with Anthropic, which will feature Amazon's latest AI training chip, Trainium 2. Previous reports claimed Nvidia's production challenges of Blackwell chips hampered AWS' data center plans. Despite production challenges, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer projected several billion dollars in revenue from Blackwell for the January quarter. He noted investors are modeling between 5 and 6 million Blackwell GPUs in 2025. Nvidia stock has surged over 201% year-to-date. Taiwan Semiconductor stock gained 98%. Investors can gain exposure to Nvidia through ProShares Ultra Semiconductors (NYSE: USD ) and EA Series Trust Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (NYSE: SHOC ).

2024-12-05 05:16:08,AAPL,Jim Cramer Says Google Could Be In Hot Water As Trump Taps Gail Slater For Antitrust Position: 'Not A Friend Of Big Tech',BZ$196d05e5,BZ,"On Wednesday, Jim Cramer voiced his apprehensions regarding Gail Slater’s potential appointment as Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust. What Happened: The host of CNBC’s Mad Money took to X , formerly Twitter , and highlighted that Slater is not perceived as a supporter of major tech companies. This includes tech giants like Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google . Her role will focus on addressing competition issues, a priority underscored by President-elect Donald Trump . Slater is expected to continue the antitrust division’s efforts against big tech, a stance Trump reiterated on his social media platform. See Also: Trump’s AI Czar Plans, Alibaba’s New Model, Cathie Wood On Tesla AI, And Musk’s Combat Transformation: This Week In Artificial Intelligence ""She’s not known as a friend of big tech,"" Cramer stated, adding, ""Not good for Google for certain.""

Her experience at the FTC involved blocking mergers, such as Whole Foods’ acquisition of Wild Oats . Why It Matters: Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice sought a court order compelling Google to divest its Chrome browser after a ruling determined the company had unlawfully monopolized the search market. President-elect Trump’s administration has signaled a tough stance on tech giants, with policies that could significantly impact companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google. Trump’s proposed tariffs, as high as 60% on goods made in China, could affect companies like Apple, which manufactures most of its products there. This could lead to increased costs for consumers. Previously, Trump expressed concerns about Google’s market power, though he stopped short of endorsing a breakup. He has also criticized the company’s search results for alleged bias. Earlier, venture capitalist David Sacks predicted a high likelihood of legal action or a breakup of Google under Trump’s administration, citing the company’s dominance in search, advertising, and YouTube .

2024-12-04 20:12:43,AAPL,Making Money From Crowd Stampede &#x2013; Palantir Becomes Largest Defense Contractor In Blink Of An Eye,BZ$196bfc4c,BZ,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Making Money From Crowd Stampede Chart of Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR ). Note the following: This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of PLTR is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows that PLTR stock has gone vertical. The chart shows that the Arora core position was bought at $20.15. The chart shows when the Arora trade around position signal was given. A trade around position is a technique used by billionaires and hedge funds that can dramatically increase returns and reduce risks. As full disclosure, The Arora Report system is close to giving another signal for a new trade around position on PLTR. Palantir is a defense contractor providing mostly AI-based software. Being a defense contractor is a complex business. Historically, it has taken defense contractors a very long period, many acquisitions, and storied histories to become large. With Palantir, it is the first time that a company has become the largest defense contractor by market cap in the blink of an eye. More remarkable is that Palantir has achieved this feat not through a long storied history and not through acquisitions. Palantir has reached this status through a momo crowd and meme crowd stampede. The chart shows that money is to be made by taking advantage of momo crowd and meme crowd stampedes. Over the years, we have helped our members make money from these stampedes on a number of stocks. Of course, prudent investors should have risk controls in place and be patient. As full disclosure, PLTR was recently added to the ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio. As full disclosure, Rtx Corp (NYSE: RTX ) is also in the ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio. RTX is the second largest defense contractor now by market cap. Here is a comparison of a few key metrics between PLTR and RTX. PLTR trailing PE is 354. RTX trailing PE is 34. PLTR forward PE is 151. RTX forward PE is 19. PLTR price/sales is 65.

Also adding to the buying are comments on Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM ) and Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL ) conference calls regarding AI.

The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD ). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV ). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (ASCA:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) is range bound. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report is very popular. The protection band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

2024-12-04 15:00:33,AAPL,"Investigating Apple's Standing In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry Compared To Competitors",BZ$196b33f3,BZ,"In today's rapidly changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, it is vital for investors and industry enthusiasts to carefully evaluate companies. In this article, we will perform a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) against its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing important financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 39.91 64.40 9.56 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 15.11 1.25 0.97 2.34% $1.23 $2.44 10.11% NetApp Inc 22.96 28.42 4.07 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 78.78 2.13 1.67 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 20.01 4.30 1.62 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 137.28 12.44 6.20 2.52% $0.08 $0.54 10.91% Eastman Kodak Co 9.54 0.55 0.58 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 56.90 3.48 1.05 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 5.02 1.26 1.79 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 17.93 1.23 0.76 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 40.39 6.12 2.08 7.37% $0.34 $0.72 167.6% Through an analysis of Apple, we can infer the following trends: The stock's Price to Earnings ratio of 39.91 is lower than the industry average by 0.99x , suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants. It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 64.4 which exceeds the industry average by 10.52x . The Price to Sales ratio of 9.56 , which is 4.6x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% , which is 16.46% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential. The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion is 95.59x above the industry average, highlighting stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 6.07% compared to the industry average of 167.6% , which indicates a challenging sales environment. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by evaluating its debt relative to its equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. In terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple can be assessed by comparing it to its top 4 peers, resulting in the following observations: Apple holds a middle position in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates a balanced financial structure with a moderate level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, despite slower revenue growth. Overall, Apple's financial performance is solid, with room for potential growth in the future. This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.

2024-12-04 14:50:52,AAPL,"Amazon Takes On Nvidia With Cheaper AI Supercomputers, Servers",BZ$196b3128,BZ,"On Tuesday, Amazon.com Inc ‘s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) cloud unit showcased fresh data center servers embedded with its artificial intelligence (AI) chips at the company’s Re:Invent event. The new servers, dubbed Trn2 UltraServers, will target Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) flagship server, packed with 72 of its latest Blackwell chips, Reuters reports. Nvidia commands the AI chips market with over 70% market share. Also Read: Marvell Unveils New Platform, Targets Growing AI Bandwidth Demands Amazon Web Services disclosed Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) as a customer for the AI chips during the event. Amazon is building artificial intelligence supercomputers in collaboration with OpenAI rival Anthropic, which will feature hundreds of thousands of Amazon’s latest AI training chip, Trainium 2. Apple executive Benoit Dupin told Reuters that Apple is already using Trainium2 chips, and AWS chief Matt Garman told Reuters that Trainium3 will debut in 2025. Gadi Hut , the business development lead for AI chips at AWS, said that AWS can connect more chips than Nvidia and that some AI models can be trained at a 40% lower cost than Nvidia chips. Amazon also announced expanded collaboration with Marvell Technology, Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL ) on AI and data connectivity products, which Bank Of America Securities analyst Justin Post deems mutually beneficial for the companies and will help alleviate some AWS dependence on supply-constrained Nvidia chips. Prior reports indicated Blackwell chips’ production challenges at Nvidia impacted AWS’ data center plans. Amazon also announced an expanded partnership with Oracle Database, Orbital Materials, and AWS’ overhaul of the cloud contact center solution with new Generative AI solutions.

2024-12-04 11:38:45,AAPL,!US Stocks Likely To Open Higher As Investors Gear Up For A Historically Strong Month: Wells Fargo Strategists See Trump Policies Setting A Backdrop Where 'Equities Continue To Rally',BZ$196ad000,BZ,"U.S. stocks could open on a positive note on Wednesday after the averages maintained a cautious stance on Tuesday . Futures of all three major indices were up on Wednesday, pointing to an optimistic sentiment on Wall Street. This is a day after the S&P 500 closed at another record high, with AI stocks and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) giving the benchmark index a boost. Markets brushed off rising geopolitical tensions across the world, with South Korean President Yoon declaring an emergency and enforcing martial law. Futures Performance (+/-) Nasdaq 100 0.51% S&P 500 0.21% Dow Jones 0.42% R2K 0.07% In premarket trading on Wednesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) rose 0.22% to $605.23 and the Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ ) gained 0.54% to $519.68, according to Benzinga Pro data . Cues From Last Session: U.S. stocks closed on a mixed note on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones closing in the red while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 edged up. Crude oil prices edged up on Wednesday after the U.S. imposed sanctions on 35 Iranian entities. Treasury yields rose as investors waited for crucial job data to be released. On the economic data front, the number of job openings rose by 372,000 to 7.744 million in October compared to a revised reading of 7.372 million in September and higher than market estimates of 7.48 million. Most sectors on the S&P 500 closed on a negative note, with utilities, industrials, and financial stocks recording the biggest losses on Tuesday. However, communication services and information technology stocks bucked the overall market trend, closing the session higher. Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite 0.40% 19,480.91 S&P 500 0.05% 6,049.88 Dow Jones -0.17% 44,705.53 Russell 2000 -0.73% 2,416.35 Insights From Analysts : Ryan Detrick , chief market strategist at Carson Group , maintained his bullish outlook on the prospects of equity markets in December. While December has traditionally been a strong one for investors, another metric shows why bears shouldn't bet against equities this month, according to Detrick. ""When the S&P 500 was up 20% or more for the year heading into the final month, December has been up nine of the past 10 times,"" said Detrick in his latest note. Data shows the S&P 500 has gained over 28% since the beginning of 2024 through November, and going by past trends, December looks set to close in the green, too. It's not just December that could be positive – Detrick's analysis shows that big gains in November set equities on a path for a rally in the new year, too. ""Do big monthly gains matter? We'd say yes, as the S&P 500 is up an average of 13.5% a year later and higher nearly 84% of the time after a calendar month gain of more than 5%."" He notes that a 5% gain in November has historically been followed by an average 13% increase the following year, occurring three out of four times. This pattern underpins Detrick's optimistic outlook. Wells Fargo strategists also expect a bull run in 2025, giving a target of 7,007 for the S&P 500. ""On balance, we expect the Trump Administration to usher in a macro environment that is increasingly favorable for stocks at a time when the Fed will be slowly reducing rates,"" said Christopher Harvey and his team of strategists. “In short, a backdrop where equities continue to rally.” See Also: How To Trade Futures Upcoming Economic Data Wednesday's economic calendar is packed.

2024-12-04 10:40:07,AAPL,!AAPL Stock Hits New High Despite Sales Slowdown: Tech Bull Says 'Street Is Realizing' iPhone 16 Marks The 'Start Of A Super Cycle' For Apple,BZ$196ab6d5,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock soared to a new 52-week high on Tuesday, closing at $242.65, despite a general market slowdown. Wedbush's Dan Ives reacted to it, reiterating his belief that the iPhone 16 is the ""start of a super cycle."" What Happened : AAPL stock rose by 1.3% on Tuesday, pulling up the broader Nasdaq Composite index. This also represented Apple’s best three-day performance since Oct. 10, when it gained 3.3%. This comes at a time when reports have pointed to iPhone sales lagging amid a lukewarm reception to new AI features. According to market research firm IDC, Apple's iPhones are expected to see a moderate 0.4% year-on-year growth in 2024, while the broader industry is expected to grow at 6.2%. Ives, who has been bullish on Apple's prospects as far as the AI uptake is concerned, explained that the skepticism about Cupertino's potential is exaggerated. See Also: Apple’s Foldable iPhone Could Spark Smartphone Market Revival In 2026, Says Expert ""The Street is starting to realize the iPhone 16 is the start to a super cycle and China sales look robust, sending the bears into hibernation mode,"" Ives told Barron's in an interview. IDC's forecast states that AI-powered smartphones will dominate sales by 2028, accounting for 70% of the total market. Ives believes Apple Intelligence-equipped iPhone 16 will help Apple post 90 million unit sales in 2025, and noted that it will help Apple hit $4 trillion in market capitalization in the coming year. Why It Matters : Apple’s recent stock performance is bolstered by several key developments. A report from BofA Securities highlights a 15.2% increase in App Store revenues in the first quarter of FY25, driven by a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle and strong service expansion. Additionally, Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has increased its stake in Apple , indicating confidence in the company’s future prospects. The hedge fund’s decision to buy more Apple shares while reducing stakes in other tech giants underscores Apple’s perceived stability and growth potential. Moreover, Apple’s strategic plans to launch a foldable iPhone by 2026 could rejuvenate the smartphone market, potentially leading to significant market share gains. Price Action: Apple stock closed at $242.65 on Tuesday, ending the day higher by 1.3%. Year-to-date, the company's stock is up 30.7%, according to Benzinga Pro data . Overall, analysts have a consensus rating of ""Buy"" on Apple stock, with the highest price target being $300. The most recent analyst ratings by Wedbush, Morgan Stanley , and Maxim Group have an average price target of $262.67, implying an 8.3% downside.

2024-12-04 07:44:25,AAPL,Apple HomePod Could Be Delayed Until 2025: Top Analyst Predicts The Device Will Play Key Part In iPhone Maker's 'Smart Home Strategy',BZ$196a6628,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is reportedly facing a delay in its ambitious smart home vision, with a key product now expected to launch in 2025. What Happened: On Wednesday, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo shared insights indicating that Apple's display-equipped HomePod , a key component of Cupertino’s strategy, has faced multiple production delays. According to Kuo, the HomePod’s mass production was initially set for 2024 but has been postponed to after WWDC 2025, primarily due to software development challenges. The new HomePod is expected to feature an A18 processor, a 6–7 inch display, and support for Apple Intelligence. See Also: Apple’s Foldable iPhone Could Spark Smartphone Market Revival In 2026, Says Expert He suggested that this product will mark a strategic shift in Apple’s HomePod lineup, similar to how the Apple Watch evolved from an iPhone accessory to a health management device.

2024-12-03 18:31:31,AAPL,!Apple's Multi-Year iPhone Cycle And App Store Dynamics Are Growth Catalysts: Analyst,BZ$1968fe04,BZ,"BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) with a price target of $256 . The analyst cited the multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flows as factors for rating reiteration. The analyst writes that, as per SensorTower data, App Store revenues in first-quarter FY25 (after 64 days) rose to $5.6 billion, a 15.2% year-over-year increase. Total downloads (iPhone and iPad) grew by 7.4% year-over-year, reaching 6.1 billion. In November, global App Store revenue increased by 15.8% year-over-year, with China showing a 9.0% year-over-year growth, adds the analyst. Mohan writes that App store dollars per download also rose by 7.3% year-over-year. Entertainment app revenue grew 35% year-over-year after 64 days and Gaming revenue increased 5% to $2.7 billion. Games remain the largest segment, followed by Entertainment (16%) and other categories, adds the analyst. Mohan says this highlights a shift toward more diverse revenue streams as non-gaming apps monetize more. The impact of the new Apple Intelligence on download and revenue trends will be closely monitored. The analyst projects total services revenue growth of 13% year-over-year for both first-quarter and second-quarter of FY25 and sees the resilience in services as a long-term positive indicator. Mohan writes that 270 days after Apple’s compliance deadline, there has been minimal impact on web browser downloads in the EU. The iPhone company reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, topping analyst estimates of $94.56 billion. Adjusted EPS of $1.64 surpassed forecasts of $1.60 .

2024-12-03 16:16:56,AAPL,"Lack Of Sellers In The Stock Market, China Retaliates Against U.S.",BZ$1968944d,BZ,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Lack Of Sellers Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The chart shows that after a very shallow pullback, the stock market has moved higher. The chart shows that in this bullish environment, the breakout line acted as support. The chart shows that the volume remains low during this rally. The interpretation in this case is that there are very few sellers. As a result, it does not take much for the market to go higher. In The Arora Report analysis, here are the reasons for the lack of sellers: Sellers want to wait until 2025 to book profits to defer paying taxes by one year. Sentiment is extremely positive. Complacency has set in among retail investors. Professional traders and money managers are waiting for the year end chase by under performing money managers. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is overbought. China is responding to the latest U.S. sanctions on the export of certain semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. China has outright banned the export of gallium, germanium, and antimony to the U.S. China is also restricting export of graphite to the U.S. These materials are important in manufacturing certain semiconductors, night vision goggles, and certain parts of satellites. Among the beneficiaries of China's restrictions on exports to the U.S. is Mp Materials Corp (NYSE: MP ). The stock is up about 13% as of this writing in the premarket. JOLTS jobs openings will be released at 10am ET and may be market moving. Investors are looking for clues to the jobs report that will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET. In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs report will play a major role in determining what the Fed does next. Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ). In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG ). In the early trade, money flows are negative in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ). In the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ). Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD ). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV ). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (ASCA:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) is range bound, trading under $95,000. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report is very popular. The protection band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

2024-12-03 16:15:23,AAPL,!Apple Might Have To Commit $1 Billion To Indonesia To Reverse iPhone 16 Ban,BZ$196892a3,BZ,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) could commit to a $1 billion investment in Indonesia in a week, Reuters cites the country’s investment minister Rosan Roeslani on Tuesday. Indonesia had banned the sale of iPhone 16 due to a violation of the country’s content rules that mandated a minimum of 40% locally sourced components for companies aiming to sell smartphones in the country. Indonesia plans to raise the investment criteria, Reuters cites a deputy minister. Also Read: Meta Weighs Sole Ownership Of A $10 Billion Subsea Cable Project In November, Indonesia rejected Apple’s $100 million investment offer to build an accessory and component plant, deeming it insufficient to lift the ban. Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia. Indonesia expects more investment from Apple in return for its inclusion in the company’s supply chain, Reuters cites Roeslani in a hearing. Previously, Indonesia barred Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) from selling its Google Pixel phones in the country for similar non-compliance. Apple’s geographical diversification of its supply chain marks its attempts to reduce dependence on China due to the disruption following China’s pandemic in 2020 and intensifying geopolitical tensions with the U.S. On Monday, the Biden administration launched its third semiconductor embargo on China, restricting Chinese chip equipment manufacturers from advanced memory chips and chipmaking tools, citing national security threats. The iPhone company reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, topping analyst estimates of $94.56 billion. Adjusted EPS of $1.64 surpassed forecasts of $1.60. Bank of America flagged potential in Apple Intelligence, boosting iPhone cycles and product demand . Goldman Sachs also projected growth with iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence. Is Apple A Good Stock To Buy? An investor can make a few decisions when deciding whether a stock is a good buy. In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages – like Apple ‘s page for example – there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter. These are known as capital allocation programs. Apple does pay a dividend, which yields 0.5% per year as of the closing price on Dec. 3, 2024. Feel free to search Benzinga's dividend calendar for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company. For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 13.81%, you'll need to buy a share of PIMCO Dynamic Income by the Dec. 12, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.22 on Jan. 2, 2025. Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on Apple will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently. Buyback programs usually serve as a support for share prices, serving as a backstop for demand. Price Action: AAPL stock is up 0.56% at $240.94 at the last check on Tuesday.

Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 39.41 63.59 9.44 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 15.07 1.25 0.97 2.34% $1.23 $2.44 10.11% Western Digital Corp 80.69 2.18 1.71 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% NetApp Inc 22.71 28.10 4.03 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Super Micro Computer Inc 20.91 4.50 1.69 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 122.79 11.96 6.16 2.52% $0.08 $0.54 10.91% Eastman Kodak Co 10.31 0.59 0.63 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 58.74 3.59 1.08 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 4.96 1.25 1.77 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 18.18 1.25 0.77 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 39.37 6.07 2.09 7.37% $0.34 $0.72 167.6% When analyzing Apple, the following trends become evident: The Price to Earnings ratio of 39.41 for this company is 1.0x above the industry average, indicating a premium valuation associated with the stock. The elevated Price to Book ratio of 63.59 relative to the industry average by 10.48x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.44 , which is 4.52x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.46% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. With higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 167.6% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a key indicator of a company's financial health and its reliance on debt financing. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When evaluating Apple alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise: Apple is positioned in the middle in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This suggests a balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a moderate level of debt while also relying on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios are all high compared to its peers, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. On the other hand, Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest strong profitability and operational efficiency relative to industry competitors.

2024-12-03 13:18:53,AAPL,!Taiwan Semi Supplier ASML Reiterates Outlook As Biden's Latest Semiconductor Embargo On China Kicks In,BZ$19680a66,BZ,"On Monday, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ: ASML ) said it does not expect the Biden administration’s latest semiconductor sanctions on China to affect its business in 2024 . On Monday, the U.S. government updated its advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing equipment rule to include additional restrictions on suppliers’ export of chip manufacturing technology. The regulations were effective immediately. Also Read: Cloudflare’s Apple Intelligence Partnership, Large TAM, Generative AI Enabler Position It For Upside, Analyst Says Biden’s administration’s third crackdown on China’s semiconductor industry targeted advanced memory chips and chipmaking tools. However, due to its agreement with the U.S., the Netherlands was exempted from the U.S. sanctions on China, which posed a relief for ASML. ASML reiterated the fiscal 2025 total net sales outlook of 30 billion euros-35 billion euros. The company expects its China business (net system sales plus net service and field option sales) to be around 20% of its total net sales for fiscal 2025. China accounted for 50% of Microchip’s fiscal 2024 net sales, as per Reuters. ASML also reiterated the 2030 annual total net sales of approximately 44 billion euros-60 billion euros as recapitulated during its Investor Day on November 14, 2024. ASML chief Christophe Fouquet had previously admitted canvassing from the U.S. to restrict chip technology sales to China. The company is a leading manufacturer of advanced lithography machines, which is integral for contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE: TSM ) for making advanced artificial intelligence chips for Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) AI processors and chips for Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones. On October 15, ASML stock plunged above 16% upon the accidental release of the third-quarter print . It reported net sales of 7.50 billion euros, topping analyst estimates of 7.12 billion euros, with a gross margin of 50.8%. The net bookings were 2.6 billion euros. ASML projected fourth-quarter net sales of 8.8 billion euros-9.2 billion euros with a gross margin of 49%-50%. The company reiterated fiscal 2024 net sales of around 28 billion euros.

2024-12-03 12:15:34,AAPL,"Apple's Foldable iPhone Could Spark Smartphone Market Revival In 2026, Says Expert",BZ$1967e252,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported plans to launch a foldable iPhone in 2026 could breathe new life into the foldable smartphone market, which has been experiencing waning consumer interest. What Happened : Display analyst Ross Young has indicated that Apple aims to enter the foldable market in the latter half of 2026. This strategic move could significantly boost the market, with projections of a record-breaking year. Young anticipates a growth of over 30% in the foldable market in 2026, followed by a 20% growth in 2027 and 2028. See Also: Apple Faces Lawsuit Over Alleged Snooping On Employees’ iPhones And Other Devices Speculation has been rife about Apple’s foldable iPhone, with analysts predicting a launch around September 2026. The device is expected to feature a size range between 7.9 and 8.3 inches, adopting a “clamshell” design akin to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip. This approach would allow the iPhone to fold vertically, offering a full-size device when opened and a compact form when closed. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters : The introduction of a foldable iPhone by Apple comes after eight generations of foldable phones from competitors like Samsung. According to a report by the Korean publication Alpha Economy, Apple has set September 2026 as the launch date for its foldable iPhone, marking a significant milestone in the company’s product lineup. Meanwhile, the global smartphone market is poised for a rebound. According to International Data Corporation , global smartphone shipments are expected to rise by 6.2% year-over-year in 2024, reaching 1.24 billion units. This growth follows two years of decline, driven by pent-up demand for device upgrades. However, growth is expected to slow to low single digits from 2025 onward. To make things difficult for Apple, Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co. has been ramping up efforts to challenge the iPhone maker's dominance. The Chinese smartphone maker recently launched the Mate XT, a tri-fold phone priced at $2,800, significantly higher than Apple’s iPhone 16 Pro Max.

2024-12-03 08:51:42,AAPL,Apple Faces Lawsuit Over Alleged Snooping On Employees' iPhones And Other Devices,BZ$19678406,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is facing a legal challenge from one of its own, as an ad tech manager has accused the company of violating employee privacy rights through its policies. What Happened : Amar Bhakta , a manager at Apple, has initiated a lawsuit against the tech giant, claiming that the company enforces policies that infringe on employee privacy rights. Bhakta alleges that Apple mandates the use of its devices and iCloud accounts, which he argues leads to privacy violations and unlawful wage clawbacks. Filed in Santa Clara superior court, the lawsuit accuses Apple of suppressing speech and conducting unauthorized surveillance. Bhakta contends that Apple’s requirement for employees to use only Apple products for work allows the company access to significant personal data. “If you use your personal account on an Apple-managed or Apple-owned iPhone, iPad or computer, any data stored on the device (including emails, photos, video, notes and more), are subject to search by Apple,” the lawsuit states. See Also: Hottest Free iPhone Apps In America Right Now: Block Blast, Threads, And ChatGPT Lead The Pack The lawsuit further claims that Apple prohibits salary discussions, contributing to gender pay disparities, and restricts the sharing of personal information online, affecting career opportunities. Bhakta’s attorney stated that they are seeking policy changes and penalties for violations. A similar case against Google resulted in a $27 million settlement. Apple did not immediately respond to Benzinga’s request for a statement. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters : This lawsuit comes amid a series of legal challenges faced by Apple. Recently, a £3 billion ($3.81 billion) legal claim was filed against Apple in the UK, accusing the company of breaching competition laws with its iCloud service. The claim alleges that Apple has abused its market position by directing customers towards its iCloud service without offering clear alternatives, potentially impacting around 40 million UK users. Additionally, Apple secured a victory in a patent dispute against Masimo Corp. , where a Delaware jury awarded Apple a symbolic $250 in damages. The jury found that Masimo’s discontinued smartwatches infringed on Apple’s patents, though current products were not found to infringe.

2024-12-03 05:18:23,AAPL,"Cathie Wood-Led Ark's Prediction: AI Will Turn Digital Wallets Into $9 Trillion E-Commerce Powerhouses &#x2014; Google, Amazon Dominance Set For Disruption?",BZ$1967125b,BZ,"ARK Invest said in November that artificial intelligence-powered digital wallets could revolutionize e-commerce, potentially driving nearly $9 trillion in global online spending by 2030 through the integration of Large Language Models into payment platforms . What Happened : The Cathie Wood -led firm’s latest research suggests that AI “purchasing agents” embedded in digital wallets like Shopify Inc ‘s (NYSE: SHOP ) Shop Pay, Cash App owned by Block Inc (NYSE: SQ ), and Apple Inc .’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple Pay could transform the traditional one-click checkout into a streamlined one-query purchase experience. This development comes as major tech companies, including Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), are rapidly advancing their AI shopping capabilities. ARK’s research suggests AI purchasing agents could disrupt Google and Amazon’s dominance by automating product comparisons and purchase decisions, reducing reliance on search engines and marketplaces. Klarna ‘s integration with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) backed OpenAI technology demonstrates early adoption of this trend, with its shopping assistant combining search and aggregation based on user preferences. “Digital wallets helmed by purchasing agents could increase their share of global e-commerce purchase volume from 50% in 2023 to 72% by 2030,” according to Ark Invest’s analysis. The firm projects that if 10% of global AI agent spending occurs through digital wallets with a 5% lead generation fee, these AI purchasing agents could generate $43 billion for digital wallet providers. See Also: Tom Lee Predicts S&P 500 To Reach 6,300, Bitcoin To Break $100K By Year-End, Says Trump’s Tariffs Can Be Effective ‘Negotiating Tools’ Why It Matters : Recent market developments support this trajectory. Amazon’s AI shopping assistant Rufus, launched nationwide in July , has already demonstrated the potential of AI in e-commerce by helping customers with product details, recommendations, and comparisons. Meanwhile, Google’s reported development of “Project Jarvis,” an AI system designed to handle shopping and travel bookings, suggests growing competition in this space . The impact of AI on e-commerce was particularly evident during Black Friday 2024, when online sales reached $10.8 billion, marking a 10.2% increase from 2023. Retailers using AI chatbots saw a 1,800% increase in website traffic and a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those without AI integration, according to Salesforce data . Ark Invest emphasizes that success in this space will require digital wallet providers to balance personalization with user privacy and trust. The firm suggests that similar to credit card rewards programs which distributed $40 billion in rewards in 2022, digital wallets will need to offer compelling incentives to drive adoption.

2024-12-02 19:26:50,AAPL,"!Fintech's New Year Playbook: Kaspi, Affirm, Shopify Set The Tone For 2025",BZ$1965e6dd,BZ,"The year 2024 may have started slow for fintech stocks , but the sector flipped the script in the second half. JPMorgan's Reginald L. Smith points to a $65 billion leap in the sector's market cap since mid-September, driven by upbeat third-quarter results, rate cuts and post-election tailwinds. As 2025 beckons, Smith envisions improving funding conditions and loan volumes lifting fintech lenders — but advises caution on current valuations ahead of the fourth quarter earnings cycle. Among the standouts are three fintech players rewriting the rulebook: Kaspi, Affirm and Shopify. Kaspi's Big Leap: 25% Potential Upside, Says Analyst Kaspi.kz JSC (NASDAQ: KSPI ) isn't just a fintech favorite — it's redefining growth in the space. With a pending majority acquisition of Turkey's Hepsiburada, Smith notes Kaspi is tackling single-country exposure concerns head-on while expanding its total addressable market. At just 8x 2025 earnings, Kaspi's robust fundamentals (30%+ revenue growth, 40%+ net income margins) note it is undervalued. The stock has a $137 price target, offering a potential 25% upside. Read Also: Future Of Investing: AI Is ‘Starting To Empower Consumers’ Affirm's BNPL Domination: 12% Projected Upside Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: AFRM ) continues to capitalize on the Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) trend, turning its partnerships with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Pay, and Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP ) into long-term growth levers. Smith highlights Affirm's strong credit metrics and reliable funding channels as key differentiators, with the company targeting profitability by FY25. With a $74 price target and 12% upside, Affirm remains a contender for fintech investors. Shopify's Subtle Brilliance With 8% Upside Shopify might not have the flashiest story, but its numbers tell a winning tale. Growing GMV (gross merchandise value) by $50 billion annually and revenue by $1.6 billion, Shopify is matching its COVID-19 pandemic-era performance while doubling its free cash flow margin. Smith believes international growth and further upmarket penetration can keep Shopify on its 20% growth trajectory, even as subscription price increases loom as a future safety net.

2024-12-02 18:38:02,AAPL,"!Cloudflare's Apple Intelligence Partnership, Large TAM, Generative AI Enabler Position It For Upside, Analyst Says",BZ$1965b453,BZ,"Cloudflare, Inc (NYSE: NET ) stock is up after Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss upgraded it from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raised its price target from $92 to $130 . Cloudflare remains one of the most compelling secular stories in Weiss’ software coverage universe, given its large TAM (total addressable market), highly scalable network architecture, and emergence as a potential GenAI enabler as organizations look to adopt and experiment with LLMs (large language models). The company is well-positioned to gain a share in the top two CIO spending priorities, Security and AI/ML. Also Read: Amazon’s AWS CEO Teases Major AI Advancements While Weiss has been on the sidelines historically, given a relatively high multiple (~17X NTM sales), he noted multiple tailwinds heading into 2025 that could drive upward estimate revisions and sustain, if not accelerate, revenue growth in an environment of increasing growth scarcity. Given the compute-intensive nature, Weiss noted that more AI inference is done at the “edge,” which means on network devices closer to the end user, for cost, latency, and data security/residency reasons. Cloudflare Workers AI, a serverless GPU-powered platform on Cloudflare’s global network, provides all the foundational elements of running AI inference on more than 300 locations worldwide. Over 2 million developers are on the Cloudflare Workers platform. Weiss’ checks indicate a solid demand for Cloudflare R2 (storage) for training AI models. While early days, Weiss noted that the upside from AI inference could be meaningful as adoption grows and Cloudflare serves ~80% of the top 50 GenAI startups. He also stressed the upside of Cloudflare as a critical partner for Apple Inc Intelligence, where the company plays a significant role in encrypting AI queries for hundreds of millions of devices. Weiss estimates this could add 2-3pts to revenue growth in 2026-28. Cloudflare is in the early innings of monetizing a wider, multi-product platform addressing over $80 billion in spending across security, networking, AI, and application services. This includes adopting developer products, including R2, Workers, AI gateway for training, inference, and monitoring AI workloads, and enterprise SASE (secure access service edge), where share gains are growing. Weiss noted faster-growing SASE and Developer/AI products growing from over 20% of revenue today to over 40% by 2028, driving durable 25-30% revenue growth in the longer term. While Cloudflare has delivered consistent product innovation across multiple domains, it lacks a more strategic selling motion to fully monetize a large installed base of over 200K customers, including over 30% of Fortune 500. Adding well-respected enterprise sales leaders like Chief Revenue Officer Mark Anderson (former Palo Alto Networks, Inc head of sales) and Head of Product CJ Desai (former ServiceNow, Inc COO) can create a much-needed strategic selling motion with large enterprises. Bottom line, with numerous product cycles in full gear, growing Edge AI contribution, and a fully ramped enterprise sales force ready to address this significant opportunity, Weiss noted that all the cards are aligned for a solid 2025 for Cloudflare, with revenue growth potentially accelerating throughout the year. This should sustain a premium multiple on higher estimates. Weiss projected fourth-quarter revenue of $451.7 million (prior $455.3 million) and adjusted EPS of $0.18 (prior $0.16).

It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 62.99 which exceeds the industry average by 10.64x . The Price to Sales ratio of 9.35 , which is 4.58x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.46% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly below the industry average of 167.6% . This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is an important measure to assess the financial structure and risk profile of a company. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By considering the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple can be compared to its top 4 peers, leading to the following observations: Apple holds a middle position in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates a balanced financial structure with a moderate level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple, the PE, PB, and PS ratios are all high compared to its peers in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, indicating that the stock may be overvalued based on these metrics. On the other hand, Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that the company is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, despite slower revenue growth compared to industry peers.

2024-12-02 09:35:45,AAPL,"BYD Surpassed Tesla In Quarterly Revenue For The First Time In Q3. It Assembles Over 30% Of iPads For Apple, And Is Now Planning To Build AI Robots For Nvidia",BZ$19642124,BZ,"China’s BYD Co. (OTC: BYDDF ) (OTC: BYDDY ), Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ: TSLA ) biggest electric vehicle rival, has quietly become a major force in Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) manufacturing ecosystem, now assembling more than 30% of iPads while planning an ambitious artificial intelligence venture with Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ). What Happened : The Shenzhen-based company, which surpassed Tesla in quarterly revenue for the first time with $28 billion versus Tesla’s $25 billion in the third quarter of 2024, has dedicated approximately 100,000 employees to Apple’s supply chain, reported The Wall Street Journal. This partnership, which began around 2009, has evolved from basic component processing to crucial assembly operations. Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged the significance of Chinese manufacturers during his November Beijing visit, his third this year, stating, “We could not do what we do without them.” The relationship has deepened despite U.S. efforts to reduce dependency on Chinese manufacturing. Beyond iPad assembly, BYD has secured critical roles in iPhone production, including manufacturing titanium frames for the latest Pro models. The company’s precision manufacturing capabilities extend to both automotive and consumer electronics, with BYD Chairman Wang Chuanfu leveraging this dual expertise to forge partnerships with other tech giants like Xiaomi and Huawei . See Also: Apple Partnership, AI Agents, And Major Infrastructure Investments: OpenAI Executives Outline Strategy To Attract 1B Users By 2025 Why It Matters : The company’s automotive division continues to show strong growth, with November 2024 sales reaching 506,804 new energy vehicles, a 68% year-over-year increase . This success in both sectors has positioned BYD for its next venture: developing AI-powered manufacturing robots in collaboration with Nvidia. Previously undisclosed details reveal that BYD and Apple’s relationship included a secretive partnership starting in 2017 to develop long-range electric vehicle batteries, though Apple has since abandoned its automotive ambitions. The collaboration influenced BYD’s current Blade battery system, now used across its entire vehicle lineup. Warren Buffett ‘s Berkshire Hathaway , an early BYD investor since 2008, has witnessed the company’s transformation from a battery manufacturer to a global technology powerhouse straddling both the automotive and consumer electronics sectors.

What Happened : “We expect tech stocks to be strong with a Santa rally as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump with Khan/FTC days in the rearview mirror, stronger AI initiatives on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla into 2025,” Ives wrote on X. The forecast comes amid projections of unprecedented AI-related spending reaching $1 trillion by the end of 2025 . JPMorgan echoes this optimistic outlook, projecting the United States to lead global growth in 2025 . The financial giant highlights the Magnificent 7 tech companies – Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Tesla Inc.

The firm projects a 5% contraction in valuation multiples for 2025, despite anticipated earnings growth .

(NASDAQ: AAPL ), and significant infrastructure investments. What Happened: “[In 2025] we will be coming into our own, as a research lab serving millions . . . hoping it can be billions of consumers around the world,” OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar told the Financial Times. After securing over $6 billion in funding at a $150 billion valuation in October, she stated that OpenAI plans to raise additional capital through both equity and debt. “We're in a massive growth phase, it behoves us to keep investing. We need to be on the frontier on the model front. That is expensive.” To meet its goals, OpenAI plans to build data center clusters in the U.S. Midwest and Southwest, according to policy chief Chris Lehane .

(NASDAQ: AMZN ). Lehane wants OpenAI to spearhead the development of AI that is led by the U.S. and aligns with democratic values, contrasting it with the Chinese approach. “This administration has talked . . . about the imperative of . . .

2024-11-29 16:33:06,AAPL,!Stock Of The Day: Classic Pattern Suggests Apple Could Head Higher,BZ$1961317c,BZ,"Trading in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is quiet Friday. The price has hardly moved. But there is a chance the stock may soon break out and head higher. A classic Ascending Triangle Pattern formed on the chart and this pattern tends to be bullish. Our expert team of technical analysts has made Apple our Stock of the Day . Technical analysis has a dubious reputation. It is easy to understand why. Many analysts try to identify patterns on charts without considering or understanding the price action they illustrate. If understood and applied correctly, technical analysis is the study of supply and demand and the investment psychology that drives the markets. Savvy traders use this knowledge to profit. An Ascending Triangle Pattern can form because of two dynamics. Buyers are aggressive and sellers are passive. As you can see on the chart, levels around $236.50 first became resistance in July. There was also resistance in late October. Now the stock has found resistance again. Read Also: Elon Musk Lauds Apple AirPods Pro 2’s Hearing Aid Feature As Tim Cook Highlights The Affordable Solution To What Otherwise Costs Up To $7,000 This means the large group of traders and investors who created the resistance with their sell orders have been patient. They have been willing to wait and let the buyers come to them. They feel no need to push the price lower. But over the same time frame, the buyers had become impatient and aggressive. They were willing to pay higher prices. Markets don't go in straight lines. They form peaks and valleys while they are trending. When a valley is higher than the one that proceeded it, traders say that it is a “higher low.” This illustrates important price action. It shows that as time has gone by, buyers were willing to enter the market at higher prices. They became increasingly aggressive. This combination of patient or complacent sellers and aggressive buyers could set the stage for Apple to break the resistance. If this happens, it could illustrate another important market dynamic. It would mean the investors and traders who created the resistance have finished or canceled their orders. With them out of the way, buyers may be forced to pay successively higher prices to attract sellers. This could force Apple into an uptrend.

2024-11-29 15:00:34,AAPL,"Investigating Apple's Standing In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry Compared To Competitors",BZ$1960d615,BZ,"In the fast-paced and highly competitive business world of today, conducting thorough company analysis is essential for investors and industry observers. In this article, we will conduct an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in relation to its major competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. Through a detailed examination of key financial metrics, market standing, and growth prospects, our objective is to provide valuable insights and illuminate company's performance in the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 38.64 62.36 9.26 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 14.75 1.22 0.95 2.34% $1.23 $2.44 10.11% NetApp Inc 22.55 27.90 4 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 78.57 2.12 1.67 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 17.46 3.75 1.41 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 122.45 11.93 6.14 2.52% $0.08 $0.54 10.91% Eastman Kodak Co 10.20 0.58 0.62 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 54.55 3.33 1.01 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 4.90 1.23 1.74 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 17.88 1.23 0.76 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 38.15 5.92 2.03 7.37% $0.34 $0.72 167.6% When conducting a detailed analysis of Apple, the following trends become clear: At 38.64 , the stock's Price to Earnings ratio significantly exceeds the industry average by 1.01x , suggesting a premium valuation relative to industry peers. It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 62.36 which exceeds the industry average by 10.53x . The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.26 , surpassing the industry average by 4.56x , may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.46% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion is 95.59x above the industry average, highlighting stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 6.07% compared to the industry average of 167.6% , which indicates a challenging sales environment. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a key indicator of a company's financial health and its reliance on debt financing. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When comparing Apple with its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be observed: Apple holds a middle position in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates a balanced financial structure with a moderate level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios are all high compared to its peers, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. On the other hand, Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest strong profitability and operational efficiency relative to industry competitors.

CEO Elon Musk endorsed Apple Inc .’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) latest health technology innovation, responding “This is cool” to CEO Tim Cook ‘s announcement of AirPods Pro 2’s new hearing aid capabilities . What Happened : Cook had shared his pride in Apple’s teams developing “powerful technologies that are improving people’s lives,” specifically highlighting the AirPods Pro 2’s personalized hearing aid feature. This development comes as Apple transforms its popular wireless earbuds into clinical-grade hearing assistance devices . The new functionality addresses a significant global health challenge, with the World Health Organization estimating that 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from hearing loss. Traditional prescription hearing aids typically cost between $2,000 and $7,000, making them inaccessible to many potential users . Apple’s comprehensive hearing health solution includes active hearing protection, an at-home hearing test, and hearing aid capabilities that adjust sound in real time based on personalized hearing profiles.

This development builds on earlier research published in iScience journal, which found that AirPods Pro met four out of five standards for personal sound amplification products. The AirPods line remains crucial to Apple’s wearables segment, which generated $9.04 billion in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue . While Apple maintains its leadership in the true wireless stereo market with a 17% share, this represents a significant decrease from its 48.1% share in 2019, reflecting increased competition in the space . The innovation comes as Apple continues to dominate the tech sector, with the company reporting overall fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, exceeding analyst expectations and demonstrating strong performance across its product ecosystem.

2024-11-28 15:00:27,AAPL,"Understanding Apple's Position In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry Compared To Competitors",BZ$195eb1de,BZ,"Amidst the fast-paced and highly competitive business environment of today, conducting comprehensive company analysis is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will delve into an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in comparison to its major competitors within the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing critical financial metrics, market position, and growth potential, our objective is to provide valuable insights for investors and offer a deeper understanding of company's performance in the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem.

It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 62.39 which exceeds the industry average by 10.14x . The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.26 , surpassing the industry average by 4.43x , may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 16.46% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The gross profit of $43.88 Billion is 60.94x above that of its industry, highlighting stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 167.6% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a key indicator of a company's financial health and its reliance on debt financing. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By considering the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Apple can be compared to its top 4 peers, leading to the following observations: When evaluating the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple is in the middle position among its top 4 peers. The company maintains a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , suggesting a relatively balanced financial structure. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales highly. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability, while the low revenue growth may indicate a need for expansion strategies to align with industry trends.

2024-11-28 13:40:28,AAPL,NFL Star Rob Gronkowski Shares How 'Listening To The Guy That Built My House' Turned $69K Into A $740K Apple Stock Jackpot,BZ$195e9927,BZ,"Former NFL player Rob Gronkowski stated that his most successful investment to date was buying shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) a decade ago. What Happened : Gronkowski shared in an interview with Fortune that his home builder advised him to invest in Apple back in 2014. “The guy actually who built my house in Foxborough, he told me, ‘Hey buy Apple stock. I’m telling you that’s where it’s at,” Gronkowski recalled. Following this advice, Gronkowski directed his financial advisor to buy $69,000 worth of Apple shares. At the time of Gronkowski’s investment, Apple was gearing up to launch the iPhone 6, which eventually became a massive success. The tech giant also debuted its first Apple Watch the following year. Since the iPhone 6’s launch on Sept. 9, 2014, Apple’s stock has skyrocketed by over 900%. Consequently, a $69,000 investment on that day would be worth around $740,000 today. See Also: Anthony Scaramucci: Trump Win Is ‘The Greatest Political Comeback In US History,’ Crypto Surge Following Gronkowski confessed that he had overlooked his Apple shares for about two-and-a-half years, only to find out they were valued at approximately $250,000. He sold a portion of the shares and kept the rest. “So I sell off the portion of the $69,000 I bought in and I have, now to this date, I have over $600,000 in Apple stock all because of the investment I made in 2014, having no idea what I was doing, but just listening to the guy that built my house here in New England so I appreciate that,” Gronkowski stated. Gronkowski, a four-time Super Bowl champion, played for the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during his 11-season NFL career. He accumulated about $70 million during his tenure in the league. Why It Matters: Apple is now facing modest growth as the smartphone market rebounds, with global shipments expected to rise by 6.2% year-over-year in 2024. However, this growth is anticipated to slow down to low single-digit figures from 2025 onwards. Tim Cook- led tech giant is facing new competition from Huawei’s advances in domestic chip technology, despite ongoing U.S. sanctions. The Chinese tech giant’s increasing market share in China, where consumer demand is rising, poses a potential threat to Apple’s position in the global smartphone market. According to data from Benzinga Pro , Apple has a consensus price target of $242.26, based on ratings from 31 analysts. The latest ratings were issued by Morgan Stanley, Maxim Group, and Barclays on Nov.25 and Nov. 1 (for both Maxim and Barclays). These three analysts have an average price target of $224, indicating a potential downside of -4.76% for the company based on their projections. Price Action: Apple stock closed flat on Wednesday at $234.93 apiece. Banks, post offices, shipping services, stock markets and all the other over-the-counter markets like bond markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving .

2024-11-28 11:22:24,AAPL,"Microsoft, HP, Dell Race To Ramp Up Production In China As Trump's Tariff Threat Looms Ahead Of His White House Return",BZ$195e68af,BZ,"Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ), HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ ), and Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL ) are ramping up their production of electronic components in China. This comes as they prepare for potential tariff hikes on Chinese imports as President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House in January. What Happened : These tech giants are accelerating their production efforts in China. Microsoft is pushing suppliers to boost output for its cloud server infrastructure while moving Xbox console assembly out of China. The company also plans to produce as many Surface laptops as possible outside China by the end of next year, Nikkei Asia reported on Thursday. Meanwhile, HP and Dell are urging suppliers to increase parts production this month and next, revisiting their procurement strategies for 2025 to lessen dependency on Chinese-made components.

2024-11-28 10:49:08,AAPL,"GOP Megadonor Ken Griffin Slashes Citadel's Palantir Stake By 91%, Bets Big On Nvidia As Jensen Huang-Led Company Rises Over 180% In 2024",BZ$195e5ef6,BZ,"GOP Megadonor Ken Griffin ‘s fund Citadel Advisors LLC made a major shift within the AI-linked investment universe by slashing its stake in Palantir Technologies Inc . (NASDAQ: PLTR ) and more than tripling its stake in Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ), as per its third quarter 13F filings with the SEC. Citadel Cuts Stake In Palantir Having been on both the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges this year, Palantir’s shares have risen by 298.37% year-to-date. This compares to 20% and 25% moves in the NYSE Composite and Nasdaq 100 Index, respectively, in the same period. Alex Karp -led company deals with providing access to artificial intelligence targeting tools to the government and military contracts. Knowing Palantir's business it's unlikely for the financial market participants to peg this company for having a vehement, meme-making fandom. However, its chief executive officer, Griffin-led fund – Citadel, has decisively cut its exposure to Palantir in the third quarter. The fund boosted its call positions by 91% and put positions by 55%, but significantly reduced its ownership from 5.68 million shares to 508,086 shares in the third quarter—a 91% decline—bringing the stake’s value to $18,900 as of Sept. 30.

It has also been in a tight race with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in terms of market capitalization. While it has surpassed Apple’s market cap earlier, at the time of the publication of this article Apple was ahead with a market cap of $3.551 trillion, while the Jensen Huang- led company stood at $3.314 trillion. Citadel, one of the largest funds in the U.S., holds positions across 14,115 companies with a total invested value of $518.2 billion. The fund increased its stake by 194% to 7.122 million shares amounting to $864.96 million in Nvidia during the third quarter. The AI industry’s bellwether, Nvidia, under the leadership of Huang, has issued optimistic projections for the forthcoming quarter and fiscal year 2025. This positive outlook is underpinned by the escalating production of the Blackwell chip. Analyst Views On Palantir And Nvidia According to Benzinga pro data , Palantir has a consensus price target of $30.22 apiece based on the ratings of 18 analysts. The highest price target among all the analysts tracked by Benzinga is $75 issued by BofA Securities on Nov. 25, whereas the lowest price target is $7.5 issued by Wolfe Research on Aug. 8, 2023. The average price target of $63.67 between BofA Securities, Wedbush, and Goldman Sachs implies a 3.83% downside for Palantir. According to Benzinga pro data , Nvidia has a consensus price target of $170.56 apiece based on the ratings of 40 analysts. The highest price target among all the analysts tracked by Benzinga is $220 per share issued by Rosenblatt on Nov. 21, whereas the lowest price target is $120 apiece issued by New Street Research on Aug. 6. The average price target of $154.67 between DA Davidson, Phillip Securities, and Truist Securities implies a 13.74% upside for Nvidia.

2024-11-28 08:05:44,AAPL,"China's State Media Commends Apple, Tesla, Starbucks For Collaboration Amid Renewed Trade War Tensions",BZ$195e0e33,BZ,"Amid rising fears of a new trade war between the U.S. and China, China’s state media have praised several American companies for their strong partnerships with Chinese counterparts. This development comes as tensions reminiscent of Donald Trump’s return to presidency resurface. What Happened : China’s state-owned Global Times has commended companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ), Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX ), and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ ) for their collaborative efforts with Chinese partners, according to a Reuters report on Thursday. The publication urged U.S. politicians to consider the willingness of American businesses to engage in economic cooperation by formulating appropriate policies. In addition, the China Daily highlighted Morgan Stanley for obtaining regulatory approval to expand its operations in China, underscoring the interest of foreign financial firms in the Chinese market. This praise coincides with Trump’s announcement of a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, aimed at addressing the opioid crisis in the U.S. See Also: Trump Names China Hawk Jamieson Greer As Pick For Trade Representative During Trump’s first term, Chinese media coverage was closely monitored by corporate executives for indications of U.S. firms’ standing. Despite threats of an “Unreliable Entity List,” China has not fully implemented it, focusing instead on companies involved in arms sales to Taiwan. Why It Matters : The recent commendation of U.S. firms by Chinese state media comes in the context of ongoing diplomatic efforts to prevent a trade war. On Nov. 13, China’s Ministry of Commerce expressed a desire for “win-win cooperation” with the U.S., even as the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese imports. Recently, Tim Cook , CEO of Apple, attended the China International Supply Chain Expo on Nov. 26. Cook’s visit, along with other American business leaders, underscores the significance of the Chinese market for U.S. companies amid potential trade tensions.

2024-11-28 06:06:37,AAPL,Lina Khan-Headed FTC Approves Probe Into Microsoft's Cloud And AI Practices Amid Antitrust Scrutiny: Report,BZ$195dda5b,BZ,"Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is confronting a federal investigation that could reshape the technology industry’s competitive landscape, with regulators examining the company’s potentially anticompetitive practices in cloud computing and artificial intelligence markets . What Happened : The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has initiated a broad investigative effort focusing on Microsoft’s licensing strategies and market conduct, particularly within its Azure cloud service ecosystem. Reuters report, which cited sources, reveals that the probe extends beyond traditional technological assessments, delving into intricate questions about market power and consumer choice. The probe, approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan before her anticipated departure , centers on allegations that Microsoft is exploiting its market power to restrict customer mobility between cloud platforms. Tech industry observers note the investigation represents a significant moment for Microsoft, traditionally viewed as more collaborative compared to other Big Tech entities. Microsoft did not immediately respond to Benzinga 's request for comment. The investigation emerges against a backdrop of intensifying regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech companies . While firms like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) have faced similar antitrust challenges, Microsoft has traditionally navigated these waters with greater apparent ease.

The timing of the probe adds complexity, occurring during a potential presidential transition that could dramatically alter enforcement priorities. Price Action : Microsoft stock closed at $422.99 on Wednesday, down 1.17% for the day. In after-hours trading, the stock dipped further 0.24%.

2024-11-27 21:21:17,AAPL,"!2025 Stock Playbook: Tap Into AI's $1 Trillion Potential, US Growth Opportunities",BZ$195cd835,BZ,"Wall Street eyes 2025 with confidence as JPMorgan declares the U.S. will remain the global growth leader. While Europe wrestles with structural woes, the emerging markets face headwinds from high interest rates and a strong dollar. Meanwhile, the U.S. is powering ahead, fueled by an AI-driven spending spree and robust capital market activity. AI Spending: A $1 Trillion Juggernaut Artificial intelligence is sparking a capital expenditure boom that dwarfs anything seen in decades. The Magnificent 7 — Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) — plan to invest over $500 billion into capex and R&D next year, roughly 25% of their combined sales. JPMorgan estimates the broader AI ecosystem could surpass $1 trillion in spending by the end of the year. This includes costs for infrastructure, engineering talent and data center upkeep. While this AI frenzy promises to drive earnings growth, JPMorgan analysts warn of potential pitfalls. Capital misallocation and lofty growth expectations could draw investor skepticism by late 2025. Still, the long-term AI opportunity is undeniable, and JPMorgan sees key players poised to capitalize. Read Also: 2025 US Economy Outlook ‘Cloudier Than Normal,’ JPMorgan Says: Boom, Bust Scenarios A Broad Earnings Recovery JPMorgan projects a bounce-back year for earnings growth in 2025. S&P 500 companies are projected to achieve an 11.4% earnings increase with all 11 sectors turning positive after 2024’s uneven performance. Meanwhile, small-cap Russell 2000 firms should see rebounding with double-digit earnings growth after enduring two years of declines. Even the Magnificent 7 are expected to sustain a 15% growth rate. JPMorgan analysts note a surprising upside could emerge if borrowing costs or the U.S. dollar ease. This should boost S&P 500 earnings by 1% for every 2% drop in the dollar. Stock Picks: Who's In JPMorgan's Cart? Here are a few of the top picks per theme, from JPMorgan’s 2025 outlook, which the firm has an Overweight (OW) rating on: AI Winners: Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM ). Deregulation Darlings: Apple, ExxonMobil Corp (NYSE: XOM ), Baker Hughes Co (NASDAQ: BKR ), Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ). America First Beneficiaries: Boeing Co (NYSE: BA ), Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: LMT ), General Motors Co (NYSE: GM ), Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F ), Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT ), and more. With an AI boom, a broad earnings recovery, and pro-American policies potentially reshaping the landscape, JPMorgan's 2025 vision sets a bold tone for the year ahead.

2024-11-27 18:55:23,AAPL,!Joe Rogan's Trump Podcast Episode Couldn't Land Him Top Spot On Apple,BZ$195ca710,BZ,"Joe Rogan's podcast is among the most listened to in the world but for Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) users, the podcaster ranked third in 2024, despite having one of the most listened to episodes with his Donald Trump i nterview before the 2024 election. What Happened: Rogan renewed a multi-year deal with Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT ) earlier this year, which comes after four years of exclusivity with the music company and huge listener figures put up year after year. Unlike past agreements with Spotify, Rogan's podcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" is no longer exclusive to Spotify and Rogan is free to share episodes on other platforms like Apple, Amazon and YouTube , the video platform owned by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Some listeners love the video aspect that shows Rogan and the interviewee, so videos and clips on YouTube have often generated millions of views. Rogan's interview with Trump before the 2024 election has 51 million views on YouTube, compared to Rogan's 18.6 million YouTube subscriber figure. Interviews with J.D. Vance and Elon Musk before the 2024 election each have 18 million viewers. While Rogan will likely rank as the top listened-to podcast on Spotify, the same can't be said for Apple podcasts. Apple recently shared its list of top podcast rankings for 2024. Here are the top shows on Apple podcasts: The Daily Crime Junkie The Joe Rogan Experience Dateline NBC SmartLess Huberman Lab This American Life New Heights with Jason & Travis Kelce Up First From NPR Morbid While many consider Rogan the new media, he failed to beat out the podcast from legacy media company The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT ), which is behind ""The Daily."" The show, hosted by Michael Barbaro and Sabrina Tavernise, lasts around 20 minutes a day, five days a week. ""Crime Junkie,"" a weekly true crime podcast, also surpassed Rogan on Apple's year-end rankings. ""The Tucker Carlson Show"" ranked first as the top new show on Apple podcasts. Rogan's interview with Trump, titled #2219, ranked as the second top episode for Apple, trailing the Crime Junkie episode ""SERIAL KILLER: The Alphabet Murders Part 1."" The episode was also the fifth most shared Apple podcast for the year. Tucker Carlson held the title for the most shared podcast episode with “Calley & Casey Means: The Truth About Ozempic, the Pill, and How Big Pharma Keeps You Sick.” A ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast episode with presidential candidate Kamala Harris was the year’s ninth most shared Apple podcast episode. Did You Know? Congress Is Making Huge Investments. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool Why It's Important : The podcast rankings are only for Apple, and Rogan will likely top the Spotify annual list when it is released before the end of the year. No longer being exclusive could allow Rogan’s content to be accessed from multiple platforms, potentially broadening his audience while distributing viewership and listenership across various channels. Despite being the most followed show on Apple Podcasts, “The Joe Rogan Experience” did not secure the top spot in the platform’s year-end rankings. This outcome is unexpected, especially considering the podcast’s high-profile guests, including former President Donald Trump. While ‘The Daily’ releases five episodes a week, Rogan typically puts out four. However, Rogan's interviews are significantly longer, often lasting several hours, compared to the shorter format of ‘The Daily.’ Rogan’s ranking among the top-listened-to podcasts on multiple platforms and generating millions of views on YouTube show that his popularity is not slowing down.

2024-11-27 18:25:14,AAPL,"Market Clubhouse Morning Memo - November 27th, 2024 (Trade Strategy For SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META And TSLA)",BZ$195c9dae,BZ,"Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY (NYSE: SPY ) is currently trading near the 599.24 level, which serves as a key area for bullish interest. If buyers manage to defend this level, the next objective will be a climb toward 600.51. A sustained push above this could lead to testing 602.48 as a critical support level. Further momentum may pave the way for a move toward 604.45, with a high bullish target set at 607.55 if the rally gains significant strength. On the downside, failure to maintain support at 599.24 may trigger selling pressure toward 598.04. Should sellers maintain control below this level, the next focus would be on 596.57. If bears continue to dominate, we could see a deeper pullback to the strong support level at 593.73. In an aggressive selloff, the low target for SPY would be 592.00. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ ) is trading near the pivotal 508.22 level, and bulls will aim to hold this as a foundation for further gains. If successful, buyers could push prices toward 509.87, with further strength targeting 511.53. If the bullish momentum persists, 513.64 comes into play, with the high bull target for the day at 515.00. However, if 508.22 fails to hold as support, the bears could drag the price down to 506.68. Breaking below this may lead to a test of 504.44, and if sellers remain in control, the next support at 502.65 could be tested. Persistent selling pressure might drive the price down to the low bear target of 501.07. Apple Inc. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is hovering around 234.20, where bulls aim to establish a base for upward movement. If this level is defended, a push toward 234.97 could follow. Strong buying momentum may propel the price to 235.74, with the ultimate bullish target for the day at 236.69 if the rally holds steady. Conversely, a failure to hold 234.20 could invite bears to test support at 233.28. Sustained downside action may lead to a retest of 231.76, with continued selling likely driving the price to 230.25. If bearish pressure accelerates, the low target for AAPL could reach 229.03. Microsoft Corp. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is trading near 426.00, where bulls aim to secure a foothold for higher prices. Holding this level could see a rally toward 427.36, with further gains bringing 428.48 into focus. If buying interest persists, the high bull target at 429.25 may be achievable. If 426.00 fails to hold, bears may seek to challenge 425.16. A break below this level could lead to further selling pressure toward 423.81. Continued weakness might push the price down to 422.84, with the low bear target for MSFT at 421.62. NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is trading near the key level of 135.64, where bulls are trying to establish control. If this level is defended, a move toward 136.98 could be the next target. Strong buying momentum may see the price test 137.94, with a high bull target of 139.42 in sight if the rally holds. If 135.64 breaks, bears may push the price lower toward 134.56. Should selling intensify, the next focus will be on 133.31. Continued weakness could lead to a test of 132.19, with the low bear target for the day at 131.42. Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is trading around 169.34, a key level for bulls to hold. A successful defense could lead to a rally toward 171.14, with further buying momentum targeting 172.28. Strong market participation could solidify gains at this high bull target. If 169.34 fails to act as support, bears may drive the price down to 167.04. A breakdown at this level could see the price test 165.41, with further downside momentum pushing the auction to the low bear target of 163.79. Meta Platforms Inc Meta (NASDAQ: META ) is near the critical level of 573.25, which bulls will aim to hold as a launching point for higher prices. If successful, we could see a rally to 580.17, followed by a test of 585.73. Sustained buying interest might bring the high bull target at 591.29 into play. On the other hand, a break below 573.25 could lead to selling pressure driving the price to 565.53. Persistent weakness may push the price lower to 559.29, with the low bear target for Meta at 553.05 if the selloff intensifies. Tesla Inc. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is trading near 340.97, a critical level for the bulls. If buyers maintain control, a move toward 346.64 could follow, with 350.87 acting as the next major resistance. A strong rally may extend gains toward 356.80, with the high bull target set at 363.84. Failure to hold 340.97 as support could result in a pullback toward 333.93. If selling pressure persists, the next target would be 327.59. A continued selloff may bring Tesla down to the low bear target of 322.52.

2024-11-27 15:00:28,AAPL,"Assessing Apple's Performance Against Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$195bfc18,BZ,"In the fast-paced and highly competitive business world of today, conducting thorough company analysis is essential for investors and industry observers. In this article, we will conduct an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in relation to its major competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. Through a detailed examination of key financial metrics, market standing, and growth prospects, our objective is to provide valuable insights and illuminate company's performance in the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 38.66 62.39 9.26 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 15.70 1.30 1.01 2.34% $1.23 $2.44 10.11% NetApp Inc 23.87 29.54 4.23 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 80.24 2.17 1.70 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 17.14 3.69 1.39 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 126.40 12.31 6.34 2.52% $0.08 $0.54 10.91% Eastman Kodak Co 9.46 0.54 0.58 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 53.87 3.29 0.99 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 4.97 1.25 1.77 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 18.08 1.25 0.77 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 38.86 6.15 2.09 7.37% $0.34 $0.72 167.6% Through a meticulous analysis of Apple, we can observe the following trends: The stock's Price to Earnings ratio of 38.66 is lower than the industry average by 0.99x , suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants. With a Price to Book ratio of 62.39 , which is 10.14x the industry average, Apple might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers. With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.26 , which is 4.43x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% that is 16.46% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 95.59x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. With higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion , which indicates 60.94x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 167.6% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio indicates the proportion of debt and equity used by a company to finance its assets and operations. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. When comparing Apple with its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be observed: In terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple is positioned in the middle among its top 4 peers. This suggests a relatively balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a moderate level of debt while also utilizing equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 . Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales highly. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability, while the low revenue growth may indicate a need for expansion strategies to align with industry trends.

2024-11-27 14:11:58,AAPL,!How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,BZ$195be993,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday . Apple is reportedly changing its approach to software updates. The tech giant appears to be opting for staggered rollouts of new features instead of bundling everything into annual iOS releases. In his latest weekly “Power On” newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said that Cupertino plans a significant update with iOS 18.4 this spring . With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.43%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,410,360 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $282,072 or around 1,200 shares. To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.9% to close at $235.06 on Tuesday.

2024-11-27 11:23:08,AAPL,Taiwan Semiconductor Ramps Up 2nm Production: Apple And AMD First In Line,BZ$195ba33c,BZ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE: TSM ) has accelerated progress on its advanced 2-nanometer fab in Kaohsiung. The company held an equipment installation ceremony six months before schedule, reflecting its efforts to meet the global demand for advanced chips. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai highlighted the milestone during a city council Q&A session, noting the facility’s potential to boost artificial intelligence (AI) applications and stimulate industrial transformation in the region, Taipei Times reports . Also Read: Spotify Introduces Marketing Tools For Audiobook Authors The chipmaker plans to establish four additional fabs in Kaohsiung, complementing its existing 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer facilities. According to Mayor Chen, these developments aim to form one of the most valuable semiconductor clusters globally. Several material, equipment, and parts suppliers have also set up operations in the city, further strengthening the ecosystem. Taiwan Semiconductor confirmed to the Taipei Times that its 2-nanometer technology is on track for mass production next year, with performance and yield already meeting or exceeding expectations. The chipmaker is constructing a similar production line at its Hsinchu facility. Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei recently told investors that demand for 2-nanometer technology has exceeded expectations, surpassing even the 3-nanometer capacity. The chips are slated for smartphones and high-performance computing, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD ) expected to adopt them early. Recent reports indicated AMD leveraging Taiwan Semiconductor’s 3nm process to foray into the smartphone market, eying flagship devices like Samsung’s models. Taiwan Semiconductor is also preparing capacity for its A16 chips , which are in high demand for AI server applications. Wei emphasized the company’s commitment to scaling 2-nanometer and A16 production to meet customer needs. The chipmaker targets capital expenditures of $34 billion—$38 billion in 2025 to meet demand for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Price Action: TSM stock is down 1.06% at $181.89 premarket at the last check on Wednesday.

2024-11-27 10:54:59,AAPL,Apple Faces Modest Growth As IDC Forecasts Smartphone Market Rebound,BZ$195b985f,BZ,"Global smartphone shipments will likely rise by 6.2% year-over-year in 2024, reaching 1.24 billion units, per International Data Corporation research . The growth comes after two consecutive years of declines, driven by pent-up demand for device upgrades. However, IDC expects a deceleration to low single-digit growth from 2025 onward, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.6% from 2023 to 2028. Also Read: Apple iPhone 16 Sees 20% Sales Surge in China, But AI Absence Prompts Early Price Cuts While generative AI (GenAI) is a crucial focus for many smartphone vendors, its immediate impact on demand still needs to be improved, according to Nabila Popal, IDC’s senior research director. Popal noted that although GenAI is poised to transform user experiences in the coming years, greater consumer awareness and compelling features are required to create the anticipated “super cycle” of upgrades. By 2028, IDC expects GenAI-enabled devices to account for 70% of the smartphone market, driven by price reductions and widespread adoption. Android smartphones are forecasted to grow 7.6% year-over-year in 2024, particularly in regions like Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan and China (APeJC), Latin America, and Africa. These gains are attributed to low-end devices catering to emerging markets. Meanwhile, Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS devices are projected to see modest growth of 0.4% due to challenges in major markets like China, the U.S., and Europe, despite solid performance in India. In 2025, iOS growth will likely accelerate to 3.1%, surpassing Android’s forecasted 1.7% growth. Foldable smartphone shipments declined by 7.4% in the third quarter of 2024, even as prominent vendors introduced new models. Nevertheless, foldable will likely grow 10.5% in 2024, maintaining a five-year CAGR of 15.9% through 2028. Challenges such as durability concerns and limited unique use cases continue to dampen their momentum, according to Anthony Scarsella, IDC’s research director. Many Chinese manufacturers are now shifting focus toward GenAI-enabled devices. IDC highlights that the expanding used smartphone market, increasing penetration, and lengthening refresh cycles will contribute to slower growth after 2024. Apple posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $94.56 billion. Adjusted earnings reached $1.64 per share, beating forecasts of $1.60. The stock surged 27% year-to-date. Analysts remain divided on Apple’s prospects, with ratings ranging from Buy to Underweight, highlighting uncertainty over future growth. Bank of America cites conservative guidance but sees potential in Apple Intelligence boosting iPhone cycles and product demand. Goldman Sachs praises strong iPhone performance offsetting Services weakness, projecting growth with iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence. Wedbush emphasizes vital iPhone upgrades and AI-driven cycles, calling the September quarter “better than feared.” Apple is reportedly adopting a new strategy for software updates, opting for staggered feature rollouts rather than bundling them into a single annual iOS release. In his latest “Power On” newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman revealed Apple’s plan for a major update with iOS 18.4, which is expected this spring. However, some features initially planned for the latter half of 2025 have been postponed. Gurman also noted delays in the much-anticipated Siri overhaul, which will integrate Apple’s in-house large language models (LLMs) for a more conversational assistant. According to Gurman, an unusually high number of features for iOS 19 are deferred until spring 2026, aligning with the release of iOS 19.4.

2024-11-27 06:07:22,AAPL,Apple's Premium Phone Reign In China Meets Challenger In Huawei's Mate 70 As New Smartphone Breaks Free From Google's Grip,BZ$195b1b82,BZ,"China's Huawei Technologies will replace Google's Android with its in-house developed operating system in smartphones and tablets starting next year. What Happened: On Tuesday, at a live-streamed event, Huawei announced that its Mate 70 series will debut HarmonyOS Next , the latest iteration of the company's operating system, reported Bloomberg. The Mate 70 and Mate 70 Pro will be available on Dec. 4, marking the company's first flagship phones without any reliance on Android, the open-source OS by Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google . Richard Yu , chairman of Huawei's consumer business group said that the Mate 70 series is expected to deliver a 40% performance boost over its predecessor. The device has a starting price of $760 (5,499 yuan) for the 6.7-inch model. See Also: Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Deals: Gift Cards Over Discounts — Here’s What You’ll Get Meanwhile, the HarmonyOS Next will take another two to three months to improve user experience, but the plans remain to integrate it into future devices. The Mate 70 series is expected to include Huawei's in-house Kirin chips, although their performance might lag behind those of competitors like Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and MediaTek . Huawei has forecasted production of more than 10 million units over the product’s life cycle, indicating strong expectations for demand. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: The new devices aim to compete directly with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in China’s premium smartphone market. In the third quarter of this year, Huawei’s market share in China increased to 15.3%, up from 8.6% last year. This development marked it as a strong rival to Cupertino in the high-end smartphone arena. Earlier this year, Huawei also surpassed Samsung Electronics Co. (OTC: SSNLF ) in global foldable smartphone shipments. Meanwhile, Google generates billions from Android, mainly via the Play Store . In the third quarter of 2024 , Google Services reported $76.5 billion in revenue, a 13% increase year-over-year. Moreover, the decision to move away from Android is significant considering the ongoing U.S. sanctions that have limited Huawei's access to critical technologies. Other Chinese tech companies are seeking ways to reduce their reliance on foreign technology. Price Action: As of this writing, Alphabet's Class A shares rose 0.047% in after-hours trading to $169.20, while Class C shares increased by 0.11% to $170.80. During Tuesday's regular session, Class A shares closed up 0.88% at $169.12, and Class C shares ended 0.70% higher at $170.62, according to Benzinga Pro data . Apple’s stock gained 0.94% on Tuesday, closing at $235.06, and saw an additional 0.20% rise in after-hours trading. Since the year began, Apple stock has risen 26.62%, more than the Nasdaq 100 index's 26.47% gain in the same period. Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link .

2024-11-27 02:01:30,AAPL,Disney Reaches $43M Settlement In Gender Pay Discrimination Lawsuit: 'Women Can Expect Equitable Treatment' Moving Forward,BZ$195a92e7,BZ,"The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS ) has agreed to pay $43.25 million to settle a gender pay discrimination lawsuit, ending years of legal proceedings. What Happened: The lawsuit, filed in 2019 by Disney employee LaRonda Rasmussen , alleged that she was paid less than male colleagues in similar roles. The case expanded as more female employees joined, leading to a California judge granting class certification in December 2023. Plaintiffs argued that Disney had a company-wide policy before 2018 that resulted in women receiving lower starting salaries than men. This was partly due to basing pay on prior salaries, which often reflected gender disparities. A labor economist’s analysis, cited by the plaintiffs, indicated that from 2015 to 2022, women at Disney earned less than their male counterparts, with a 2.01% female pay penalty. See Also: Dell Technologies Shares Drop After Q3 Revenue Misses Estimates: Details Disney contested these findings, maintaining their commitment to fair pay. A Disney spokesperson stated, “We have always been committed to paying our employees fairly and have demonstrated that commitment throughout this case.” Christine Webber , representing the plaintiffs, praised the women involved, stating, “This settlement would not be possible without these courageous women. Because of them, women can expect equitable treatment at Disney in the future.” Why It Matters: The settlement comes amid a broader trend of gender pay discrimination lawsuits in major corporations. Earlier this year in June, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) faced a class-action lawsuit alleging unequal pay for women, highlighting ongoing issues in Silicon Valley. Similarly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) settled a gender discrimination lawsuit for $215 million in May 2023, and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) agreed to a $118 million settlement in June 2022. Earlier this month, Disney reported strong financial performance, with a 6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 . Price Action: Disney’s stock declined 0.47% on Tuesday, closing at $115.45, followed by a 0.11% drop in after-hours trading. Year-to-date, Disney shares have risen 27.27%, slightly outperforming the Nasdaq 100 index, which is up 26.47%, according to Benzinga Pro data .

2024-11-26 23:28:22,AAPL,"Back Up The Truck Buying Opportunities May Be Ahead, Record Bets On Bitcoin Drop",BZ$195a69db,BZ,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Buying Opportunity Ahead Please click here for an enlarged chart of iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (NYSE: EWW ). Note the following: President-elect Trump is threatening to impose steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada using an executive order on his first day in office. Mexico's president is responding by claiming that migrant caravans are no longer arriving at the U.S. border. She is also offering cooperation to stem the flow of drugs to the U.S. If negotiations with Mexico do not go well, stocks in Mexico will be decimated. That will likely be an opportunity for long-term investors to back up the truck and buy stocks in Mexico. The reason is that there are simply not enough people in the U.S. to support economic growth and on-shoring of all of the manufacturing from China. The chart shows Mexico ETF EWW is oversold. However, EWW can become more oversold. Mexico ETF EWW can easily fall to the top support zone shown on the chart. In The Arora Report analysis, the back up the truck buying opportunity will tentatively occur if Mexico ETF EWW falls to the lower support zone shown on the chart. However, this is all data dependent. Investors should carefully follow the data points. Investors need to look ahead and be prepared if the opportunity in Mexico arises. Mexico has been continuously covered in The Arora Report’s ZYX Emerging for 17 years. As full disclosure, if there is a back up the truck buying opportunity, a signal will be made in The Arora Report’s Real Time Feed of ZYX Emerging. In a buy signal, the support zone is only one of many factors. The algorithms used by The Arora Report are highly complex and combine the best elements of macro analysis, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and quantitative analysis with an overlay of change. Identifying change early and being prepared to capture opportunity leads to big gains. Trump is also threatening Canada with steep tariffs. If Canadian stocks are decimated, there will be an opportunity to buy Canada ETF iShares MSCI Canada ETF (NYSE: EWC ). Again, investors need to be prepared ahead of time to capture the opportunity if it arises. As full disclosure, a signal to buy Canadian stocks will be in The Arora Report’s ZYX Allocation. Yesterday evening, when the news broke of Trump's tariff plan, stock futures were first quickly sold. Then, the momo crowd stepped in and has been aggressively buying the dip. There are important developments in bitcoin. Please scroll down to the bitcoin section below. Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are positive in Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ). In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ). In the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ ). Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD ). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV ). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (NYSE: USO ). Bitcoin At a time when almost everyone is bullish on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) and cryptos, money flows are at a record to short bitcoin. As an example, money flows in ProShares UltraShort Bitcoin ETF (ARCA : SBIT) were at a record $18.8M yesterday. Of course, money flows in short bets on bitcoin pale in comparison to money flows in long bets. Bitcoin whales took profits in the zone of $93,000 – $98,000, taking advantage of super excited retail investors. At a time when retail investors were converting their dollars into bitcoins, bitcoin whales were converting their bitcoins into dollars. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report is very popular. The protection band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

2024-11-26 15:00:27,AAPL,"Analyzing Apple In Comparison To Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals Industry",BZ$195929d3,BZ,"In the ever-changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, conducting thorough company analysis is crucial for investors and industry experts. In this article, we will undertake a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and its primary competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By closely examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, our aim is to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry. Apple Background Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. Company P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 38.30 61.81 9.18 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 15.75 1.31 1.01 2.34% $1.23 $2.44 10.11% Western Digital Corp 76.29 2.06 1.62 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Super Micro Computer Inc 19.12 4.11 1.55 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Pure Storage Inc 124.41 12.12 6.24 2.52% $0.08 $0.54 10.91% Eastman Kodak Co 8.93 0.51 0.54 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 54.74 3.35 1.01 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% Immersion Corp 5.04 1.27 1.79 13.41% $0.03 $0.06 1323.8% AstroNova Inc 17.69 1.22 0.75 -0.34% $0.0 $0.01 14.12% Average 40.25 3.24 1.81 4.19% $0.33 $0.66 187.78% When conducting a detailed analysis of Apple, the following trends become clear: A Price to Earnings ratio of 38.3 significantly below the industry average by 0.95x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth. With a Price to Book ratio of 61.81 , which is 19.08x the industry average, Apple might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers. The Price to Sales ratio of 9.18 , which is 5.07x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83% is 19.64% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion , which is 98.48x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The gross profit of $43.88 Billion is 66.48x above that of its industry, highlighting stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 187.78% . This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio gauges the extent to which a company has financed its operations through debt relative to equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By evaluating Apple against its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following observations arise: Compared to its top 4 peers, Apple has a higher debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87 , indicating a higher level of debt financing. This higher debt proportion can expose the company to increased financial risk and potential challenges. Key Takeaways For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Apple's assets and sales more than its earnings. Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit reflect strong profitability and operational efficiency. However, the low revenue growth implies slower expansion compared to industry peers.

2024-11-26 14:15:30,AAPL,"Xiaomi Set To Challenge Qualcomm, MediaTek As It Ventures Into Chipmaking Once Again",BZ$1959176e,BZ,"Xiaomi Corp. (OTC: XIACF ) is set to launch its own mobile processor for future smartphones, aiming to lessen its dependency on foreign suppliers like Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and MediaTek Inc . (OTC: MDTKF ). What Happened : This strategic move aligns with Beijing’s push for local firms to minimize reliance on foreign technology. Xiaomi’s initiative comes amid a broader trend of tech giants investing in semiconductor development, a critical area in the ongoing tech race with the United States, according to Bloomberg on Tuesday, the chip’s mass production is slated for 2025. Xiaomi’s chipmaking efforts could potentially challenge its current manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (NYSE: TSM ) especially as the latter faces increasing pressure from U.S. authorities regarding its dealings with Chinese clients. See Also: Weekend Round-Up: AI Dominates Headlines With Nvidia, Elon Musk, And Hollywood’s Big Names In addition to mobile processors, Xiaomi’s investment in research and development is projected to rise to 30 billion yuan in 2025, focusing on artificial intelligence and operating system enhancements. Chairman and CEO Lei Jun announced these plans during a recent company event, emphasizing the importance of core technologies, Bloomberg reported. Why It Matters : Previously, Xiaomi launched its first in-house chip “Surge S1,” a mid-range system-on-chip (SoC) in 2017 for its Mi 5C smartphone. However, the adoption was limited due to competition from Qualcomm and MediaTek. A reported attempt to develop the “Surge S2” chip was halted due to production delays and technical hurdles in 2020, as per Gizmochina. The development of Xiaomi’s in-house chips is a significant step in China’s broader strategy to become self-reliant in critical technology sectors. This move is part of a larger trend where Chinese tech companies are increasingly investing in semiconductor technology to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers. Recently, in a move to challenge the dominance of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Huawei introduced its latest flagship smartphone, the Mate 70, featuring the HarmonyOS Next. This new operating system has been developed entirely in-house, marking a significant step for Huawei in the mobile OS market.

2024-11-26 10:08:56,AAPL,Apple May Delay Key iOS 19 Features As It Reportedly Adopts Staggered Rollouts Amid AI Investment Push,BZ$1958a0ae,BZ,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is reportedly changing its approach to software updates. The tech giant appears to be opting for staggered rollouts of new features instead of bundling everything into annual iOS releases. What Happened: In his latest weekly ""Power On"" newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said that Cupertino plans a significant update with iOS 18.4 this spring. However, several features that were initially set for the latter half of 2025 are now delayed. Previously, the analyst reported that the much-anticipated Siri overhaul, which aims to incorporate in-house LLMs for a more conversational assistant, was also pushed back. Beyond LLMS, a larger-than-usual number of features for iOS 19 are also postponed till spring 2026. That's around when iOS 19.4 will be released, said Gurman in the newsletter. See Also: Apple Could Keep AirPods Max Headphones Around Without ‘Meaningfully’ Updating Them, Says Analyst: Here’s Why Apple is planning a big update for spring with iOS 18.4, but some capabilities planned for later in 2025 are already postponed. I'm told that a larger-than-usual number of features for iOS 19 (beyond LLM Siri) are already delayed till spring 2026 (19.4). https://t.co/j7au0Dp4MD — Mark Gurman (@markgurman) November 24, 2024 Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: Earlier this month, Cupertino alerted investors about the potential uncertainty in the profitability of its future products, including AI and virtual reality. In its updated annual report, Apple included a new “risk factors” section, highlighting that some of its upcoming products may not achieve the same revenue and profit margins as its flagship product, the iPhone. Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $94.56 billion. The company also posted adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share, beating the anticipated $1.60 per share. This marked the seventh straight quarter that Apple has outperformed analyst forecasts for both revenue and earnings, according to Benzinga Pro . During the earnings call at the time, Apple CEO Tim Cook shared that the adoption rate of iOS 18.1 is double that of iOS 17.1. During the same call, Apple CFO Luca Maestri was asked about the company's capital expenditure outlook, particularly concerning investments in private cloud computing and AI. What Analysts Are Saying: Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng inquired whether these investments could affect Apple’s typical annual capex range of around $10 billion. In response, Maestri explained that Apple uses a hybrid model for its data centers, combining both proprietary and third-party resources. This makes its capex numbers distinct from other companies. He confirmed that Apple is already investing in infrastructure to support its AI-related features, with additional spending planned for fiscal year 2025. In its 10-K filing filed in November, Apple reported research and development expenses of $31.37 billion, rising 5% over 2023. Price Action: Apple’s stock rose 1.31% on Monday, closing at $232.87, but dipped 0.18% in after-hours trading. Year-to-date, the company’s shares have increased by 25.44%, slightly trailing the Nasdaq 100 index, which has gained 25.8%, according to Benzinga Pro data .
