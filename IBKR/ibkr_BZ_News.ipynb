      "Full Article Text: <p>President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong> announced on Tuesday that the Emirati real estate development firm <strong>DAMAC Properties</strong> will invest $20 billion to construct data centers in the U.S. to meet the growing needs of hyperscale customers. The race for dominance in artificial intelligence hit an inflection point as <strong>Microsoft </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\">MSFT</a>) revealed its <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42801720/microsoft-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-data-centers-for-fiscal-2025\">$80 billion investment plan</a> to build AI-driven data centers in fiscal 2025, with special regional focus on the U.S.</p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p>These developments serve as a green light for investors looking to invest in this theme. Risk-averse investors who are interested in cashing in on this opportunity, but are reluctant to choose individual stocks can choose from a plethora of ETFs tied to data center and digital infrastructure stocks. Here we name 3 such ETFs, which carry stocks of digital infrastructure providers like Microsoft and are poised to mirror the gains of the digital infrastructure industry.</p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42806852/microsoft-pauses-construction-on-33-billion-mount-pleasant-data-center-project-cites-technology-changes-and-design-re-evaluation\">Microsoft Pauses Construction On $3.3 Billion Data Center Expected To Be Used By ChatGPT-Parent OpenAI For Massive Super Computer</a></strong></p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p><strong>Vanguard Information Technology ETF </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VGT#NYSE\">VGT</a>), with a low expense ratio of only 0.10% and $98 billion under management, holds the maximum position in <strong>Apple </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) with a 16.19% current weightage. <strong>Nvidia </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) and Microsoft are right behind, enjoying weightage of 15.42% and 13.05% of the fund&#8217;s total allocation, respectively.</p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p><strong>iShares U.S. Technology ETF </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IYW#NYSE\">IYW</a>) has $20.5 billion funds under management and charges an expense ratio of 0.39%. It derives its allocation strategies from the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index. Nvidia (15.59%),  Apple (15.57) and Microsoft (14.16%) take up the three biggest pieces of the pie. </p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p><strong>Global X Data Center REITs &amp; Digital Infrastructure ETF </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VPN#NASDAQ\">VPN</a>) focuses exclusively on companies developing and operating data centers. Microsoft and Apple might not be included in the fund currently, but compelling stocks like <strong>Equinix </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/EQUIX#NASDAQ\">EQUIX</a>), Nvidia and <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMD#NASDAQ\">AMD</a>) enjoy a place in the fund&#8217;s portfolio. Expense ratio that the fund management charges is 0.50%.</p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p><strong>Some Notes On Major Fund Holdings</strong></p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p>Data centers run by Apple boast unique design features to support energy conservation and have been running on 100% renewable energy since 2014. Nvidia, on the other hand, is expected to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42269031/nvidias-blackwell-liquid-cooling-revolution-fuels-ai-growth\">ramp up production</a> of liquid-cooled GB200 server racks in the current quarter.</p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p>Data center REIT Equinix recently acquired BT's data center business in Ireland. Advanced Micro&#8217;s aMI300 product line, featuring high-performance GPU accelerators, is expected to rake in more than $5 billion in revenue for 2024, according to Dataconomy.</p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p><strong>Parting Thoughts</strong></p>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p>Digital infrastructure is the backbone of modern technology. From AI and cloud computing to blockchain and 5G, the global economy relies on robust data centers to keep pace with innovation.

Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.</p>&#10;<table>&#10;<thead>&#10;<tr>&#10;<th><strong>Company</strong></th>&#10;<th><strong>P/E</strong></th>&#10;<th><strong>P/B</strong></th>&#10;<th><strong>P/S</strong></th>&#10;<th><strong>ROE</strong></th>&#10;<th><strong>EBITDA (in billions)</strong></th>&#10;<th><strong>Gross Profit (in billions)</strong></th>&#10;<th><strong>Revenue Growth</strong></th>&#10;</tr>&#10;</thead>&#10;<tbody>&#10;<tr>&#10;<td>Apple Inc</td>&#10;<td>40.30</td>&#10;<td>65.03</td>&#10;<td>9.65</td>&#10;<td>23.83%</td>&#10;<td>$32.5</td>&#10;<td>$43.88</td>&#10;<td>6.07%</td>&#10;</tr>&#10;<tr>&#10;<td>Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co</td>&#10;<td>11.84</td>&#10;<td>1.21</td>&#10;<td>1.01</td>&#10;<td>5.72%</td>&#10;<td>$1.44</td>&#10;<td>$2.61</td>&#10;<td>15.06%</td>&#10;</tr>&#10;<tr>&#10;<td>NetApp Inc</td>&#10;<td>21.73</td>&#10;<td>26.89</td>&#10;<td>3.86</td>&#10;<td>32.84%</td>&#10;<td>$0.44</td>&#10;<td>$1.18</td>&#10;<td>6.15%</td>&#10;</tr>&#10;<tr>&#10;<td>Western Digital Corp</td>&#10;<td>72.14</td>&#10;<td>1.95</td>&#10;<td>1.53</td>&#10;<td>4.28%</td>&#10;<td>$0.86</td>&#10;<td>$1.55</td>&#10;<td>48.91%</td>&#10;</tr>&#10;<tr>&#10;<td>Super Micro Computer Inc</td>&#10;<td>18.14</td>&#10;<td>3.90</td>&#10;<td>1.47</td>&#10;<td>6.68%</td>&#10;<td>$0.4</td>&#10;<td>$0.6</td>&#10;<td>37.87%</td>&#10;</tr>&#10;<tr>&#10;<td>Pure Storage Inc</td>&#10;<td>165.51</td>&#10;<td>14.93</td>&#10;<td>7.47</td>&#10;<td>4.44%</td>&#10;<td>$0.11</td>&#10;<td>$0.58</td>&#10;<td>8.94%</td>&#10;</tr>&#10;<tr>&#10;<td>Eastman Kodak Co</td>&#10;<td>9.31</td>&#10;<td>0.53</td>&#10;<td>0.57</td>&#10;<td>1.34%</td>&#10;<td>$0.04</td>&#10;<td>$0.04</td>&#10;<td>-2.97%</td>&#10;</tr>&#10;<tr>&#10;<td>AstroNova Inc</td>&#10;<td>23.53</td>&#10;<td>0.98</td>&#10;<td>0.59</td>&#10;<td>0.26%</td>&#10;<td>$0.0</td>&#10;<td>$0.01</td>&#10;<td>7.65%</td>&#10;</tr>&#10;<tr>&#10;<td><strong>Average</strong></td>&#10;<td><strong>46.03</strong></td>&#10;<td><strong>7.2</strong></td>&#10;<td><strong>2.36</strong></td>&#10;<td><strong>7.94%</strong></td>&#10;<td><strong>$0.47</strong></td>&#10;<td><strong>$0.94</strong></td>&#10;<td><strong>17.37%</strong></td>&#10;</tr>&#10;</tbody>&#10;</table>&#10;&#10;<style>&#10;        table {&#10;            width: 100%;&#10;            border-collapse: collapse;&#10;            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;&#10;            font-size: 14px;&#10;        }&#10;&#10;        th, td {&#10;            padding: 8px;&#10;            text-align: left;&#10;        }&#10;&#10;        th {&#10;            background-color: #293a5a;&#10;            color: #fff;&#10;            text-align: left;&#10;        }&#10;&#10;        tr:nth-child(even) {&#10;            background-color: #f2f4f8;&#10;        }&#10;&#10;        tr:hover {&#10;            background-color: #e1e4ea;&#10;        }&#10;&#10;        td:nth-child(3), td:nth-child(5) {&#10;            text-align: left;&#10;        }&#10;&#10;        .dividend-amount {&#10;            font-weight: bold;&#10;            color: #0d6efd;&#10;        }&#10;&#10;        .dividend-frequency {&#10;            font-size: 12px;&#10;            color: #6c757d;&#10;        }&#10;    </style>&#10;&#10;<p>Through a meticulous analysis of Apple, we can observe the following trends: </p>&#10;<ul>&#10;<li>&#10;<p>The Price to Earnings ratio of <b>40.3</b> is <b>0.88x</b> lower than the industry average, indicating potential undervaluation for the stock.</p>&#10;</li>&#10;<li>&#10;<p>It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of <b>65.03</b> which exceeds the industry average by <b>9.03x</b>.</p>&#10;</li>&#10;<li>&#10;<p>The Price to Sales ratio of <b>9.65</b>, which is <b>4.09x</b> the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers.</p>&#10;</li>&#10;<li>&#10;<p>The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of <b>23.83%</b>, which is <b>15.89%</b> above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.</p>&#10;</li>&#10;<li>&#10;<p>Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of <b>$32.5 Billion</b>, which is <b>69.15x</b> above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.</p>&#10;</li>&#10;<li>&#10;<p>With higher gross profit of <b>$43.88 Billion</b>, which indicates <b>46.68x</b> above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.</p>&#10;</li>&#10;<li>&#10;<p>The company's revenue growth of <b>6.07%</b> is significantly below the industry average of <b>17.37%</b>.

However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is performing well financially but may face challenges in revenue expansion compared to industry peers.</p>&#10;<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.

       "      <td>On Monday, Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL ) announced a major rebranding of its personal computers, aiming to boost sales by adopting a simplified naming strategy similar to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). What Happened: The company has decided to retire long-standing product names like “XPS” and “Inspiron” in favor of a streamlined approach centered around the Dell name. The rebranding is part of Dell’s strategy to make its products more appealing and less confusing for consumers. The new lineup will feature three tiers: Dell , Dell Pro , and Dell Pro Max , echoing Apple’s naming conventions. See Also: Jensen Huang Unveils $3000 ‘Personal AI Supercomputer' The Size Of A Small Book: ‘It Runs The Entire Nvidia AI Stack' The rebranding is also part of a broader effort to encourage PC upgrades, with AI-optimized systems and the end of support for Microsoft Corp.’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows 10 as potential catalysts. Notably, Dell’s gaming brand, Alienware , will not be affected by the rebranding. The new Dell-branded devices will incorporate neural processing units to improve AI capabilities.

Why It Matters: In November 2024, Dell announced earnings of $2.15 per share for the third quarter, surpassing the analyst consensus estimate of $2.05.

In the third quarter of 2024, Dell’s share of global PC shipments dropped to 15.7%, down from 16.7% in the previous quarter. The company remains the third-largest PC vendor worldwide, trailing behind Lenovo and HP, according to Statista. Price Action: Dell's stock fell by 2.72% on Tuesday, ending the day at $121.27. However, the stock bounced back in Wednesday's pre-market session, increasing by 1.3% to $122.85, according to Benzinga Pro data .

       "      <td>President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the Emirati real estate development firm DAMAC Properties will invest $20 billion to construct data centers in the U.S. to meet the growing needs of hyperscale customers. The race for dominance in artificial intelligence hit an inflection point as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) revealed its $80 billion investment plan to build AI-driven data centers in fiscal 2025, with special regional focus on the U.S. These developments serve as a green light for investors looking to invest in this theme. Risk-averse investors who are interested in cashing in on this opportunity, but are reluctant to choose individual stocks can choose from a plethora of ETFs tied to data center and digital infrastructure stocks. Here we name 3 such ETFs, which carry stocks of digital infrastructure providers like Microsoft and are poised to mirror the gains of the digital infrastructure industry. See Also: Microsoft Pauses Construction On $3.3 Billion Data Center Expected To Be Used By ChatGPT-Parent OpenAI For Massive Super Computer Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSE: VGT ), with a low expense ratio of only 0.10% and $98 billion under management, holds the maximum position in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) with a 16.19% current weightage. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Microsoft are right behind, enjoying weightage of 15.42% and 13.05% of the fund’s total allocation, respectively. iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE: IYW ) has $20.5 billion funds under management and charges an expense ratio of 0.39%. It derives its allocation strategies from the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index. Nvidia (15.59%), Apple (15.57) and Microsoft (14.16%) take up the three biggest pieces of the pie. Global X Data Center REITs &amp; Digital Infrastructure ETF (NASDAQ: VPN ) focuses exclusively on companies developing and operating data centers. Microsoft and Apple might not be included in the fund currently, but compelling stocks like Equinix (NASDAQ: EQUIX ), Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) enjoy a place in the fund’s portfolio. Expense ratio that the fund management charges is 0.50%. Some Notes On Major Fund Holdings Data centers run by Apple boast unique design features to support energy conservation and have been running on 100% renewable energy since 2014. Nvidia, on the other hand, is expected to ramp up production of liquid-cooled GB200 server racks in the current quarter. Data center REIT Equinix recently acquired BT's data center business in Ireland. Advanced Micro’s aMI300 product line, featuring high-performance GPU accelerators, is expected to rake in more than $5 billion in revenue for 2024, according to Dataconomy. Parting Thoughts Digital infrastructure is the backbone of modern technology. From AI and cloud computing to blockchain and 5G, the global economy relies on robust data centers to keep pace with innovation. A Research And Markets study shows that the Data Center services market, which grew from $56.65 billion in 2023 to $62.23 billion in 2024, is likely to witness a CAGR of 9.99%, hitting $110.34 billion by 2030. Whether it's leveraging Microsoft-heavy funds like VGT or targeting niche players through VPN, investors have a range of tools to capitalize on this transformative megatrend.

(NYSE: DELL ) announced a major rebranding of its personal computers, aiming to boost sales by adopting a simplified naming strategy similar to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). What Happened: The company has decided to retire long-standing product names like “XPS” and “Inspiron” in favor of a streamlined approach centered around the Dell name. The rebranding is part of Dell’s strategy to make its products more appealing and less confusing for consumers. The new lineup will feature three tiers: Dell , Dell Pro , and Dell Pro Max , echoing Apple’s naming conventions.

Notably, Dell’s gaming brand, Alienware , will not be affected by the rebranding. The new Dell-branded devices will incorporate neural processing units to improve AI capabilities.

In the third quarter of 2024, Dell’s share of global PC shipments dropped to 15.7%, down from 16.7% in the previous quarter. The company remains the third-largest PC vendor worldwide, trailing behind Lenovo and HP, according to Statista. Price Action: Dell's stock fell by 2.72% on Tuesday, ending the day at $121.27. However, the stock bounced back in Wednesday's pre-market session, increasing by 1.3% to $122.85, according to Benzinga Pro data .

       "1  President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the Emirati real estate development firm DAMAC Properties will invest $20 billion to construct data centers in the U.S. to meet the growing needs of hyperscale customers. The race for dominance in artificial intelligence hit an inflection point as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) revealed its $80 billion investment plan to build AI-driven data centers in fiscal 2025, with special regional focus on the U.S. These developments serve as a green light for investors looking to invest in this theme. Risk-averse investors who are interested in cashing in on this opportunity, but are reluctant to choose individual stocks can choose from a plethora of ETFs tied to data center and digital infrastructure stocks. Here we name 3 such ETFs, which carry stocks of digital infrastructure providers like Microsoft and are poised to mirror the gains of the digital infrastructure industry. See Also: Microsoft Pauses Construction On $3.3 Billion Data Center Expected To Be Used By ChatGPT-Parent OpenAI For Massive Super Computer Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSE: VGT ), with a low expense ratio of only 0.10% and $98 billion under management, holds the maximum position in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) with a 16.19% current weightage. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Microsoft are right behind, enjoying weightage of 15.42% and 13.05% of the fund’s total allocation, respectively. iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE: IYW ) has $20.5 billion funds under management and charges an expense ratio of 0.39%. It derives its allocation strategies from the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index. Nvidia (15.59%), Apple (15.57) and Microsoft (14.16%) take up the three biggest pieces of the pie. Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF (NASDAQ: VPN ) focuses exclusively on companies developing and operating data centers. Microsoft and Apple might not be included in the fund currently, but compelling stocks like Equinix (NASDAQ: EQUIX ), Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) enjoy a place in the fund’s portfolio. Expense ratio that the fund management charges is 0.50%. Some Notes On Major Fund Holdings Data centers run by Apple boast unique design features to support energy conservation and have been running on 100% renewable energy since 2014. Nvidia, on the other hand, is expected to ramp up production of liquid-cooled GB200 server racks in the current quarter. Data center REIT Equinix recently acquired BT's data center business in Ireland. Advanced Micro’s aMI300 product line, featuring high-performance GPU accelerators, is expected to rake in more than $5 billion in revenue for 2024, according to Dataconomy. Parting Thoughts Digital infrastructure is the backbone of modern technology. From AI and cloud computing to blockchain and 5G, the global economy relies on robust data centers to keep pace with innovation. A Research And Markets study shows that the Data Center services market, which grew from $56.65 billion in 2023 to $62.23 billion in 2024, is likely to witness a CAGR of 9.99%, hitting $110.34 billion by 2030. Whether it's leveraging Microsoft-heavy funds like VGT or targeting niche players through VPN, investors have a range of tools to capitalize on this transformative megatrend.
