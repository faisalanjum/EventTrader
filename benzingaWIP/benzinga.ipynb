      "Body: <p><strong>Meta Platforms Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>) CEO <strong>Mark Zuckerberg </strong>criticized <strong>Apple Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) for its lack of innovation and restrictive policies during a recent<strong> Joe Rogan</strong> podcast appearance on Saturday, escalating a long-standing rivalry between <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42931722/steve-jobs-invented-the-iphone-and-now-theyre-justsitting-on-it-mark-zuckerberg-hints-at-apples-potential-downfall-amid-iphone-makers-random-rules\">Silicon Valley&#8217;s tech giants</a>.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: &#8220;<strong>Steve Jobs</strong> invented the iPhone and now they&#8217;re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,&#8221; Zuckerberg said, suggesting Apple hasn&#8217;t &#8220;really invented anything great in a while.&#8221; He also claimed Meta&#8217;s profits could double without Apple&#8217;s &#8220;random rules&#8221; and 30% App Store commission.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The criticism comes as Apple faces mounting regulatory pressure over its App Store policies. The U.S. Department of Justice is pursuing antitrust action against the iPhone maker, while European Union regulations are forcing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/tech/24/11/42086154/apple-to-argue-for-dismissal-of-doj-antitrust-case-over-alleged-us-smartphone-market-domination\">changes to its closed ecosystem</a>.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This latest clash follows years of tension between the two companies, dating back to 2014 when Apple CEO<strong> Tim Cook </strong>first criticized Facebook&#8217;s data collection practices. The relationship deteriorated further after the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal when Cook publicly stated on MSNBC that he &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t be in this situation&#8221; regarding Facebook&#8217;s privacy issues.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The conflict intensified in 2021 when Apple introduced privacy features requiring apps to get user permission for tracking, significantly impacting Meta&#8217;s advertising revenue. Zuckerberg reportedly told executives that Facebook needed to &#8220;inflict pain&#8221; on Apple in response, according <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/technology/mark-zuckerberg-tim-cook-facebook-apple.html\">to</a> the New York Times.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>More recently, Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/04/38424000/mark-zuckerberg-shades-apple-vision-pro-once-again-calls-it-fashionable-ai-glasses-without-a-display\">questioned the market viability</a> of Apple&#8217;s Vision Pro headset during Meta&#8217;s first-quarter 2023 earnings call, suggesting consumers would prefer &#8220;fashionable AI glasses without a display.&#8221;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For investors, this ongoing rivalry highlights fundamental differences in business models: Meta&#8217;s advertising-dependent, data-driven approach versus Apple&#8217;s hardware-focused, privacy-centric strategy. While Meta&#8217;s stock surged on Thursday, reaching $615.01, Apple shares have declined 2.34% to $237.02, according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">data from Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n",

      "<p>Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.</p>\n",

Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit signify strong profitability, while the low revenue growth implies slower expansion compared to industry peers.</p>\n",
