Historical News - Rest API
Current News    - WebSocket

1. News Unique IDs & Deduplication (refer to generate_unique_id_and_classify_news in qc):
    - WebSocket has Action (either Created or Updated)
    - Rest API need to check if it has same Field

2. Final:
    1. Remove news with no symbol
    2. Removes duplicate ( 'id', 'updatedat', and 'symbol') since same news id can be associated 
       with different symbols (for example multiSymbolNews)
       - drop_duplicates , keep='first'?
    3. Remove news with exact same fields (except for say embedding)


Things to consider:
1. What to do with Created versus Updated?
2. What to do with news with no content/body?
3. Rows with same ID may be associated with different symbols 
   (you assign a counter by starting at max_counter already in exsiting news)


Classifying the news type:
1. ['news_type'] = 'UnspecifiedEvent'  # default label
2. Unique news event: News with a unique 'id' (not seen before in either old_rows or new_rows)
3. Updated Event: Identify news with the same 'id' and 'symbol', but different 'updatedat'.
   - Rows with identical 'id', 'symbol', and 'updatedat' have already been removed, 
     making all remaining duplicates valid 'UpdatedEvent' candidates.
4. Multi-symbol news: News with same 'id' but different 'Symbol'
5. Current rules applied for filtering news:
    - News type must be 'UniqueEvent'
    - More so for qc since it checks if the associated symbol is in the symbols column list
    - 'updatedAfter' value must be <= time_difference_threshold
    - Symbols column must contain exactly 1 symbol (removes multi-ticker news)
