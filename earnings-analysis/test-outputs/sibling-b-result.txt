SIBLING_B_DONE: blue | SAW_A: no | FILE_A_EXISTS: yes

Details:
- Wrote SIBLING_B_SECRET = blue to sibling-b-secret.txt
- Did NOT see SIBLING_A_SECRET in my context (context isolation confirmed)
- File sibling-a-secret.txt EXISTS on filesystem (contains: SIBLING_A_SECRET = red)
- I only discovered sibling A's secret by reading the file, not from shared context
