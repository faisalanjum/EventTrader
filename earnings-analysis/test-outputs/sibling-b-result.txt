======================
Timestamp: 2026-02-01T00:00:00Z

1. WROTE SECRET: SIBLING_B_SECRET = blue
   File: /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/test-outputs/sibling-b-secret.txt

2. CONTEXT SEARCH FOR "SIBLING_A_SECRET":
   - Searched entire context (system prompt, CLAUDE.md, skill instructions)
   - Found: NO
   - The skill list mentions "test-sibling-a" as an available skill name
   - BUT no actual secret value or "SIBLING_A_SECRET" string appears in context
   
3. FILE EXISTENCE CHECK:
   - File: sibling-a-secret.txt
   - Exists on filesystem: YES (from previous execution)
   - Size: 23 bytes, dated Jan 16

CONCLUSION: Sibling skills do NOT share context. Each runs in isolation.
The only cross-sibling visibility is via filesystem (persistent storage).

SIBLING_B_DONE: blue | SAW_A: no | FILE_A_EXISTS: yes
