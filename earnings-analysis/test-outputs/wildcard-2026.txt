WILDCARD_PRELOAD: NO

Test: Does MCP wildcard `mcp__neo4j-cypher__*` pre-load tools?
Method: Checked whether mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher is callable without ToolSearch.
Result: The tool is explicitly listed as a "deferred tool" that "must be loaded before use" via ToolSearch.
         It is NOT pre-loaded by any wildcard allowlist pattern.
Conclusion: Wildcard entries in allowedTools (e.g. mcp__neo4j-cypher__*) grant PERMISSION to use
            the tools but do NOT pre-load them. ToolSearch is still required to materialize deferred
            MCP tools before they can be invoked.
