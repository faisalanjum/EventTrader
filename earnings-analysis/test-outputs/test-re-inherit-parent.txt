Test: Tool inheritance (parent has NO MCP, child has MCP)
Date: 2026-02-05

Parent allowed-tools: Skill, Write (NO MCP)
Child allowed-tools: mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher

Child returned:
  CHILD_MCP: WORKS
  Query result: [{"source": "child_mcp"}]
  Child used mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher directly without ToolSearch.

INHERIT_DOWN: NO
Reason: Parent has no MCP tools. Child successfully used its own allowed-tools
(mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher) independently. No downward inheritance occurred;
the child's own allowed-tools config was authoritative.
