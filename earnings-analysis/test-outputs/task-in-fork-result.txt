# Task Tool Availability Test in Forked Skill Context

**Test Date**: 2026-02-05
**Skill**: test-task-in-fork
**Context**: Forked skill execution
**Model**: claude-opus-4-5

## Results Summary

### Task (Subagent Spawning) Tool
**STATUS: NOT AVAILABLE**

The Task tool for spawning subagents (Explore, Code, etc.) is NOT available in this forked skill context.
- ToolSearch query "Task subagent spawn agent" returned: No matching deferred tools found
- Cannot delegate work to specialized subagents from within a fork

### Task Management Tools (TaskCreate, TaskList, TaskUpdate, TaskGet)
**STATUS: AVAILABLE**

These tools ARE available and functional in the forked skill context:
- TaskList executed successfully (returned "No tasks found" - empty task list)
- These tools manage a to-do list within the conversation, NOT subagent spawning

## Available Tools in Fork Context

The following 17 tools ARE available:

### File Operations
1. Bash - Execute shell commands
2. Glob - Pattern-based file search
3. Grep - Content search with regex
4. Read - Read file contents
5. Edit - Edit files with string replacement
6. Write - Write/create files
7. NotebookEdit - Edit Jupyter notebooks

### Web Operations
8. WebFetch - Fetch and process web content
9. WebSearch - Search the web

### Task List Management (NOT subagent spawning)
10. TaskCreate - Create tasks in task list
11. TaskGet - Get task by ID
12. TaskUpdate - Update task status
13. TaskList - List all tasks

### Other Tools
14. Skill - Invoke other skills
15. ToolSearch - Search for deferred tools
16. ListMcpResourcesTool - List MCP resources
17. ReadMcpResourceTool - Read MCP resources

## Key Distinction

There are TWO different "Task" concepts:

1. **Task Subagent Tool** (for spawning Explore/Code/etc. agents)
   - NOT AVAILABLE in forked skill context
   - Cannot delegate to specialized subagents
   - Must use Skill tool or direct tools instead

2. **Task Management Tools** (TaskCreate, TaskList, TaskGet, TaskUpdate)
   - AVAILABLE in forked skill context
   - Used for tracking work items in a to-do list
   - Can create, read, update task items

## README.md Files Found (Using Glob Instead of Subagent)

Since Task subagent tool was unavailable, used Glob directly to find README.md files:

### Project README.md Files (excluding venv):
1. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/README.md
2. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/XBRL/README.md
3. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/drivers/README.md
4. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/drivers/Archived/README.md
5. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/drivers/drivers_graph/query_engine/README.md
6. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/drivers/drivers_graph/query_engine_v2/README.md
7. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/k8s-disaster-recovery/20250708_112320/README.md

### Total README.md files found: 26 (7 project files, 19 in venv/site-packages)

## Conclusion

In forked skill context:
- Task SUBAGENT spawning tool is NOT available - cannot spawn Explore/Code subagents
- Task MANAGEMENT tools (TaskCreate, TaskList, etc.) ARE available for tracking work
- Skills must use direct tools (Bash, Glob, Grep, etc.) or invoke other skills via Skill tool
- Alternative approaches (like using Glob directly) work fine for tasks that would otherwise use subagents
