# Mock Attribution Summary (Layer 2)

## Layer Identification
- **Skill**: mock-attribution
- **Layer**: 2 (forked skill)
- **Timestamp**: 2026-01-16
- **Model**: claude-opus-4-5

## Task Subagent Status

**IMPORTANT**: The Task tool for spawning subagents (Layer 3) was NOT available in the current tool set.

Available tools were:
- Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, Edit, Write
- NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch
- Skill, MCPSearch, ListMcpResourcesTool, ReadMcpResourceTool

The Task tool with subagent_type="Explore" was specified in the skill instructions but is not present. This is a significant finding for the 4-layer thinking test architecture.

## File Count Result (Direct Exploration)

Since the Task subagent could not be spawned, I performed the CSV file count directly using Glob:

**CSV files found in earnings-analysis/: 3**

Files:
1. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/8k_fact_universe.csv
2. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/predictions_queue.csv
3. /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/predictions.csv

## Architecture Test Implications

For the 4-layer thinking token capture test:
```
Layer 0: Main Claude session - OK
Layer 1: mock-orchestrator (Skill tool) - OK
Layer 2: mock-attribution (Skill tool) - THIS LAYER - OK
Layer 3: Task subagent - NOT AVAILABLE (Task tool missing)
```

The test reveals that:
1. Forked skills (via Skill tool) work correctly at Layer 1 and Layer 2
2. The Task tool for spawning subagents is not currently available
3. To complete the 4-layer test, the Task tool needs to be added to the available tools

## Conclusion

Mock-attribution (Layer 2) executed successfully with ultrathink reasoning, but could not spawn a Layer 3 Task subagent due to missing Task tool. The CSV file count was obtained directly: **3 files**.
