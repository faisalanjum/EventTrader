MCP_PRELOAD: NEEDS_TOOLSEARCH

Details:
- The tool mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher is listed as a "deferred tool" in the ToolSearch description.
- Deferred tools are explicitly marked: "must be loaded before use."
- The allowed-tools declaration in SKILL.md does NOT pre-load MCP tools into the active function set.
- The tool cannot be invoked without first calling ToolSearch to load it.
- Query "RETURN 1 AS test" was NOT executed because the tool is unavailable without ToolSearch.
- Retest date: 2026-02-05
