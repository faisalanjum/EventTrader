# Test: agent: field in Skill Frontmatter
Generated: 2026-01-16

## Skill Configuration
```yaml
agent: neo4j-report
context: fork
```

## Expected Behavior (if agent: field works)
The skill should inherit from neo4j-report agent:
- permissionMode: dontAsk
- tools: mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher
- model: opus

## Actual Test Results

### 1. Was agent: field recognized?
**UNCLEAR** - No explicit indication that agent: field was parsed.

### 2. Was MCP tool directly accessible?
**NO** - Had to use MCPSearch to load `mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher` first.
If agent: field worked, the tool should have been pre-loaded.

### 3. Did MCPSearch work?
**YES** - Tool was loaded successfully after MCPSearch call.

### 4. Did query execute?
**YES** - Query ran without errors.
Result: [] (MSFT not in database, but query executed)

### 5. Were there permission prompts?
**NO** - No permission prompts appeared.
But this may be because the skill has `context: fork` not because of agent: field.

## Conclusion

**The `agent:` field does NOT appear to grant the skill the agent's tools automatically.**

Evidence:
- MCP tool was NOT pre-loaded (had to use MCPSearch)
- Cannot confirm if permissionMode: dontAsk came from agent: field or from fork context

### Workaround
If you need MCP tools in a forked skill:
1. Include `MCPSearch` in allowed-tools (though allowed-tools isn't enforced anyway)
2. Call MCPSearch to load the MCP tool
3. Then use the MCP tool

The agent: field may only be meaningful for Task tool subagents, not Skill tool forks.
