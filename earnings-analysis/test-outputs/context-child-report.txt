# Context Child Test Report
Generated: 2026-01-16

## 1. Arguments Passed
YES - I can see the arguments in the skill instructions:
- Raw arguments: "parent_says_hello ticker=AAPL"
- This appears as part of the skill header: "Arguments: parent_says_hello ticker=AAPL"

## 2. Conversation History from Parent
LIMITED - I can see:
- The git status snapshot from the start of the conversation
- Current branch: main
- Modified file: earnings-analysis/predictions.csv
- Recent commits visible (e.g., e0e2431, 33a27cc, etc.)

However, I do NOT see any explicit messages or tool calls from a "parent" skill.
The conversation appears to start fresh with just the system context.

## 3. Files the Parent Read
NO - I do not see any evidence of files being read by a parent skill.
There are no Read tool results in my visible context.
The only file content I can see is CLAUDE.md which is injected via system-reminder.

## 4. Working Directory
YES - My working directory is: /home/faisal/EventMarketDB
This is shown in the <env> block:
- Working directory: /home/faisal/EventMarketDB
- Is directory a git repo: Yes
- Platform: linux

## 5. CLAUDE.md Content
YES - I can see the full CLAUDE.md content.
It is injected via a <system-reminder> tag and contains:
- Kubernetes cluster infrastructure details
- Physical node specifications (minisforum, minisforum2, minisforum3)
- Pod configurations by namespace
- MCP Integration details
- Claude Operating Guidelines
- Critical Don'ts section

The CLAUDE.md content is approximately 12KB and includes tables for:
- Physical Nodes
- Pods by Namespace
- Networking (NodePorts)
- KEDA Autoscaling
- Storage
- Logging System

## Summary
As a child skill, I have access to:
- [x] Arguments passed to the skill
- [x] Git status snapshot
- [x] Working directory information
- [x] CLAUDE.md content (via system-reminder)
- [ ] Parent's conversation history (NOT visible)
- [ ] Files read by parent (NOT visible)

The child skill appears to run in a relatively isolated context with only
the skill arguments and standard system context (CLAUDE.md, env info) available.
