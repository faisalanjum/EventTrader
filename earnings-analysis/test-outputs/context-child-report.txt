Context Child Test Report
=========================
Generated: 2026-02-01 (Second Run)

## 1. Arguments Passed
NO - No arguments were passed this time.
The skill header shows: "Arguments:" followed by nothing (empty).

Comparison to previous run: The previous test received "parent_says_hello ticker=AAPL"
but this run received no arguments.

## 2. Conversation History from Parent
LIMITED - I can see:
- The git status snapshot from the start of the conversation
- Current branch: main
- Modified files listed (e.g., earnings-analysis/predictions.csv, various scripts)
- Recent commits visible (e.g., ea7a921, f61b3c0, afe6735, etc.)
- Untracked files including this test directory

However, I do NOT see any explicit messages or tool calls from a "parent" skill.
The conversation appears to start fresh with just the system context.

## 3. Files the Parent Read
NO - I do not see any evidence of files being read by a parent skill.
There are no Read tool results in my visible context.
The only file content I can see is CLAUDE.md which is injected via system-reminder.

## 4. Working Directory
YES - My working directory is: /home/faisal/EventMarketDB
This is shown in the <env> block:
- Working directory: /home/faisal/EventMarketDB
- Is directory a git repo: Yes
- Platform: linux
- OS Version: Linux 5.15.0-164-generic
- Today's date: 2026-02-01

## 5. CLAUDE.md Content
YES - I can see the full CLAUDE.md content.
It is injected via a <system-reminder> tag and contains:
- Kubernetes cluster infrastructure details
- Physical node specifications (minisforum, minisforum2, minisforum3)
- Pod configurations by namespace (Processing, Infrastructure, Neo4j, MCP Services)
- Networking details (NodePorts for Redis, Neo4j, Grafana, etc.)
- KEDA Autoscaling configurations
- Storage and PVC information
- Logging System details
- Processing Modes (Historical vs Live)
- XBRL Processing workflow
- MCP Integration (three setups)
- Claude Operating Guidelines
- Critical Don'ts section

## Summary
As a child skill (this run), I have access to:
- [ ] Arguments passed to the skill (NONE this time)
- [x] Git status snapshot (modified files, recent commits, current branch)
- [x] Working directory information (/home/faisal/EventMarketDB)
- [x] CLAUDE.md content (via system-reminder)
- [ ] Parent's conversation history (NOT visible)
- [ ] Files read by parent (NOT visible)
- [ ] Data artifacts from parent (NOT visible)

The child skill runs in an isolated context with only the skill arguments
and standard system context (CLAUDE.md, env info) available. There is no
mechanism to pass file contents or conversation state from parent to child.

Key Finding: Arguments must be explicitly passed via the skill invocation.
This run had no arguments, unlike the previous test which had arguments.
