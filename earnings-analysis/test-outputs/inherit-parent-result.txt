TEST: TOOL INHERITANCE - PARENT RESULT
================================================================================

TEST DATE: 2026-01-16
PARENT SKILL: test-inherit-parent
CHILD SKILL: test-inherit-child

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PARENT'S ALLOWED-TOOLS CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The parent skill (test-inherit-parent) does NOT have any MCP tools in its
allowed-tools list. Specifically:
- NO mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher
- NO mcp__neo4j-cypher__write_neo4j_cypher
- NO mcp__neo4j-cypher__get_neo4j_schema

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHILD'S RESULT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHILD_MCP_ACCESS: YES

The child skill successfully executed the MCP tool:
- Tool used: mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher
- Query: Fetched company name for ticker 'IBM'
- Result: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP

The child was able to directly call the MCP tool without needing MCPSearch
because the tool was specified in the child's own allowed-tools configuration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINDING: Tool access is determined by each skill's OWN allowed-tools config,
         not inherited from parent.

KEY INSIGHT:
- Parent does NOT have MCP tools in allowed-tools
- Child DOES have MCP tools in allowed-tools
- Child CAN use MCP tools despite parent not having them

This confirms that:
1. Skills have independent tool access based on their own configuration
2. A child skill is NOT restricted by its parent's allowed-tools
3. Each forked skill context evaluates allowed-tools independently
4. MCP tools in allowed-tools are made available without MCPSearch

INHERITANCE MODEL: Isolated (not inherited from parent)
