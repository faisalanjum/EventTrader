MEMORY_SCOPE: local
MEMORY_PRELOAD: NO
MEMORY_DIR_CREATED: YES
MEMORY_WRITE: WORKS
MEMORY_READ: MEMORY_LOCAL_TEST=mango_2026_local
MEMORY_LOCAL: NOT_WORKING

DETAILS:
- No MEMORY.md content was found preloaded in the system prompt.
- The directory .claude/agent-memory-local/test-memory-local/ did NOT exist before this test; it had to be created manually.
- The existing memory directory was .claude/agent-memory/ (used by a different memory scope).
- File write to .claude/agent-memory-local/test-memory-local/MEMORY.md succeeded.
- File read back confirmed content: MEMORY_LOCAL_TEST=mango_2026_local
- MEMORY_LOCAL verdict: NOT_WORKING because the memory directory was not auto-created and no MEMORY.md was preloaded into the system prompt by the framework. The "memory: local" feature did not provision the agent-memory-local directory or inject prior memory content automatically.
