TEST: model: field in skill frontmatter
DATE: 2026-01-16
SKILL: test-model-field
FRONTMATTER: model: haiku

RESULT: MODEL FIELD NOT ENFORCED

OBSERVED MODEL: Claude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)
EXPECTED MODEL: Haiku (if model: field worked)

EVIDENCE:
- System info states: "You are powered by the model named Opus 4.5"
- Model ID: claude-opus-4-5-20251101
- Response style: Detailed (consistent with Opus, not Haiku's brevity)

CONCLUSION:
The `model:` field in skill frontmatter does NOT override the model.
The skill runs with the same model as the parent conversation.

WORKAROUND:
- For ./agent: Use --model flag explicitly
- For Claude CLI skills: Model is inherited from session, cannot be overridden per-skill
- For cost savings at Layer 3: Use ./agent with --provider and --model flags
