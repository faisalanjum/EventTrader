# MCP Wildcard Test Results

## Test: Does `mcp__neo4j-cypher__*` pre-load MCP tools?

### Result: NO - Wildcard does NOT pre-load MCP tools

### Findings:

1. **MCP tool directly available (no MCPSearch needed)?**
   - NO
   - The tool `mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher` was NOT in the directly available tools list
   - It was listed in MCPSearch description as "must be loaded before use"
   - Had to explicitly call MCPSearch with `select:mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher` to load it

2. **Query executed successfully?**
   - YES
   - After loading via MCPSearch, the query executed without errors

3. **Query result:**
   - Query: `MATCH (c:Company {ticker: 'AAPL'}) RETURN c.name LIMIT 1`
   - Result: `[{"c.name": "APPLE INC"}]`

4. **Did wildcard `mcp__neo4j-cypher__*` work for pre-loading?**
   - NO
   - The wildcard pattern in allowed-tools does NOT automatically load MCP tools
   - MCP tools must still be explicitly loaded via MCPSearch before use
   - The wildcard appears to only PERMIT access to the tools, not PRE-LOAD them

### Conclusion:

The `mcp__neo4j-cypher__*` wildcard pattern in skill allowed-tools:
- DOES grant permission to use matching MCP tools
- Does NOT pre-load them into the available tools list
- MCPSearch is still required as a prerequisite step to load the tool before calling it

This is the expected behavior - wildcards control access permissions, while MCPSearch controls tool loading.
