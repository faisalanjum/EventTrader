START_TIME: 1769352189.222535057
END_TIME: 1769352225.353362891
ELAPSED: 36.130827834s
VERDICT: SEQUENTIAL if elapsed >= 6s, PARALLEL if elapsed < 5s

=== ANALYSIS ===
The skills ran SEQUENTIALLY, not in parallel.

Evidence:
- Skill A timestamp: 1769352196.881616949
- Skill B timestamp: 1769352210.956992669
- Gap between skill starts: 14.075375720s

If they had run in parallel, both timestamps would be within ~1 second.
Instead, Skill B started ~14.075375720s after Skill A, proving sequential execution.

CONCLUSION: context:fork skills inside a sub-agent execute SEQUENTIALLY
