=== MOCK-ORCHESTRATOR (Layer 1) - Reasoning ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-16

## Purpose
This is the mock-orchestrator skill operating at Layer 1 of a 4-layer test architecture.
The goal is to validate thinking token capture across nested skill invocations.

## 4-Layer Architecture Being Tested

Layer 0 (Main):
  - Entry point where user invokes /mock-orchestrator
  - Represents the root conversation context
  - Thinking tokens at this layer: main conversation's extended thinking

Layer 1 (Orchestrator - THIS LAYER):
  - The mock-orchestrator skill (current execution)
  - Coordinates calls to child skills (prediction and attribution)
  - Uses ultrathink mode for extended reasoning
  - Writes outputs to test-outputs directory

Layer 2 (Child Skills):
  - mock-prediction: Simulates earnings prediction analysis
  - mock-attribution: Simulates post-earnings attribution analysis
  - Each skill should capture its own thinking tokens
  - These skills further spawn Task subagents

Layer 3 (Task Subagents):
  - Spawned by Layer 2 skills via the Task tool
  - Innermost layer of execution
  - Tests whether thinking is preserved at deepest nesting

## Key Questions This Test Answers

1. Are thinking tokens captured at each layer?
2. Do child skill invocations preserve parent context?
3. Can we trace reasoning across the full call stack?
4. Is ultrathink mode effective at nested depths?

## Next Steps
1. Invoke /mock-prediction skill (Layer 2)
2. Invoke /mock-attribution skill (Layer 2)
3. Collect results from both child skills
4. Write final summary with complete layer analysis
