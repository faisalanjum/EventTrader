RT5_FILE_CONFLICT_TEST
======================
team: test-teams-rt5
date: 2026-02-05
writers: 3 (writer-1, writer-2, writer-3)

SHARED FILE BEHAVIOR:
  all_wrote_successfully: YES
  final_content: LINE_FROM_WRITER_3 (last writer wins)
  worktrees_used: NO (all share same filesystem)

WRITE ORDER (observed):
  1. writer-1 wrote LINE_FROM_WRITER_1
  2. writer-2 read writer-1's content, then overwrote with LINE_FROM_WRITER_2
  3. writer-3 read writer-1's content, got stale-file error (writer-2 changed it),
     re-read (saw writer-2's content), then overwrote with LINE_FROM_WRITER_3

CONFLICT HANDLING:
  Write_tool: No protection — last-write-wins (overwrites silently)
  Edit_tool: Stale-file detection — fails if file changed since last read
  Automatic_merge: NONE
  Git_worktrees: NOT USED by teammates

IMPLICATION: Teammates must coordinate via task list or messaging to avoid
writing to the same file. Use separate output files per teammate, then
have lead merge results.
