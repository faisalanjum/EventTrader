TIMESTAMP: 2026-01-25T12:45:00Z

TASK STRUCTURE CREATED:
#1 AAPL-Q1: News Impact Analysis
#2 AAPL-Q1: Guidance Inventory Update
#3 AAPL-Q1: Earnings Prediction
#4 AAPL-Q1: Earnings Attribution

DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION:
- Task 1 (news-impact): [no blockers] - blocks #3
- Task 2 (guidance): [no blockers] - blocks #3
- Task 3 (prediction): [blocked by #1, #2] - blocks #4
- Task 4 (attribution): [blocked by #3]

EXECUTION SIMULATION:
Wave 1 Start: Tasks 1,2 marked in_progress (parallel execution)
Wave 1 Complete: Tasks 1,2 marked completed
Task 3 Status: UNBLOCKED (no longer shows blocked annotation in TaskList)
Wave 2 Start: Task 3 marked in_progress
Wave 2 Complete: Task 3 marked completed
Task 4 Status: UNBLOCKED (no longer shows blocked annotation in TaskList)
Wave 3 Complete: Task 4 marked completed

FINAL TASK LIST:
#1 [completed] AAPL-Q1: News Impact Analysis
#2 [completed] AAPL-Q1: Guidance Inventory Update
#3 [completed] AAPL-Q1: Earnings Prediction
#4 [completed] AAPL-Q1: Earnings Attribution

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
1. Tasks can be created with dependencies using addBlockedBy
2. TaskList dynamically removes [blocked by ...] annotation when blockers complete
3. TaskGet shows historical dependency relationships (Blocked by / Blocks)
4. Parallel tasks (Wave 1) can run simultaneously with no blockers
5. Dependency chain correctly enforces: Wave 1 -> Wave 2 -> Wave 3

CONCLUSION: tradeEarnings pattern WORKS
