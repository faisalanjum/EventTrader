# Mock Prediction Reasoning (Layer 2)

## Test Context
This is the **mock-prediction skill** operating at Layer 2 in a multi-layer thinking token capture test.

## Architecture Being Tested
- **Layer 1**: Mock Orchestrator (forked skill) - calls prediction and attribution skills
- **Layer 2**: Mock Prediction (this skill - forked skill) - calls Task subagent
- **Layer 3**: Task subagent (Explore type) - executes the actual search

## What We're Testing
1. Whether thinking tokens are properly captured when a forked skill (Layer 2) calls a Task subagent (Layer 3)
2. The propagation of ultrathink mode through nested skill/agent invocations
3. Context preservation across agent boundaries

## My Task
1. Use ultrathink for analysis (this reasoning demonstrates that)
2. Call a Task subagent with subagent_type="Explore" to find all SKILL.md files
3. Document the results

## Analysis
The key architectural question is: when the mock-orchestrator (Layer 1) invokes mock-prediction (Layer 2), and mock-prediction then spawns a Task subagent (Layer 3), do thinking tokens flow correctly at each layer?

This test validates:
- Forked skill to forked skill communication (Layer 1 -> Layer 2)
- Forked skill to Task subagent communication (Layer 2 -> Layer 3)
- Results propagation back up the chain

## Next Step
Invoking Task subagent to find SKILL.md files in .claude/skills/
