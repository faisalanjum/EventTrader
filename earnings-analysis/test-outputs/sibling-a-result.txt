SIBLING_A_DONE: red | SAW_B: no

Findings (run 2026-02-01):
- Confirmed SIBLING_A_SECRET = red in sibling-a-secret.txt
- Searched for SIBLING_B_SECRET in my invocation context: NOT FOUND
- sibling-b-secret.txt file: EXISTS (contains "SIBLING_B_SECRET = blue")
- I can READ the file from disk, but it was NOT in my skill context
- Grep found SIBLING_B_SECRET only in SKILL.md definition files, not in runtime context

Conclusion: Sibling skills do NOT share runtime context. Each sibling operates in isolation.
File system access allows reading sibling outputs, but no context bleeding occurs.
