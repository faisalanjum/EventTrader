SIBLING_A_DONE: red | SAW_B: no

Findings:
- Wrote SIBLING_A_SECRET = red to sibling-a-secret.txt
- Searched for SIBLING_B_SECRET in context: Only found references in SKILL.md definition files, not in any runtime data
- sibling-b-secret.txt file: NOT_EXISTS
- No evidence of sibling B's secret value being shared in my context

Conclusion: Sibling skills do NOT share runtime context. Each sibling operates in isolation.
