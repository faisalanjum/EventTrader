TIMESTAMP: 2026-01-25T01:47:32Z
CLI_VERSION: Unknown (forked skill context)

TOOL AVAILABILITY:
- TaskCreate: NOT AVAILABLE (Error: No such tool available)
- TaskList: NOT AVAILABLE (Error: No such tool available)
- TaskGet: NOT AVAILABLE (Error: No such tool available)
- TaskUpdate: NOT AVAILABLE (Error: No such tool available)

ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE:
- TodoWrite: AVAILABLE (task management through todo system)

TEST RESULTS:
1. TaskCreate: FAILED - Tool not available, returned "No such tool available: TaskCreate"
   Task ID: N/A
2. TaskList: FAILED - Tool not available, returned "No such tool available: TaskList"
   Task count: N/A
3. TaskGet: FAILED - Tool not available, returned "No such tool available: TaskGet"
4. TaskUpdate (in_progress): FAILED - Tool not available, returned "No such tool available: TaskUpdate"
5. TaskUpdate (completed): FAILED - Tool not available, returned "No such tool available: TaskUpdate"

ALTERNATIVE TEST WITH TodoWrite:
- Created todo task with subject "TEST_A_CUSTOM_ID_TASK": PASS
- Current todo system has task management capabilities through TodoWrite
- Tasks are managed through TodoWrite tool instead of separate Task tools

ACTUAL VERIFICATION:
- Attempted to call each Task tool directly and received "No such tool available" errors
- TodoWrite successfully manages tasks in this forked skill context

CONCLUSION: Task tools (TaskCreate, TaskList, TaskGet, TaskUpdate) ARE NOT available in forked skills.
However, TodoWrite provides task management functionality as an alternative.
