NESTED TASK TEST RESULTS

The Task tool is NOT available to this sub-agent.

ALL AVAILABLE TOOLS:

1. Bash - Execute terminal commands (git, npm, docker, etc.)
2. Glob - Fast file pattern matching

TASK TOOL SPAWN ATTEMPT:
------------------------
Cannot attempt to spawn nested task - Task tool is not in my available toolset.

CONCLUSION:
-----------
This sub-agent does NOT have the ability to spawn further sub-agents via a Task tool.
The Task tool appears to be restricted/unavailable at this agent level.
This prevents infinite sub-agent spawning chains.
