=== MOCK-ORCHESTRATOR (Layer 1) - Final Summary ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-16

## Execution Overview
This is the mock-orchestrator skill operating at Layer 1.
Both child skills (mock-prediction and mock-attribution) have completed execution.

## Complete Layer Structure Tested

## Child Skill Results

### Mock-Prediction (Layer 2) Results
- Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Files Created:
  - /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/test-outputs/mock-prediction-reasoning.txt
  - /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/test-outputs/mock-prediction-summary.txt
- Key Findings:
  - Found 28 SKILL.md files in .claude/skills/
  - Skills organized into 6 categories: Neo4j(7), Perplexity(6), Earnings(3), Alpha Vantage(2), Test/Mock(6), Utility(4)
- Layer 3 Status: Task tool not available; used Glob directly

### Mock-Attribution (Layer 2) Results
- Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Files Created:
  - /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/test-outputs/mock-attribution-reasoning.txt
  - /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/test-outputs/mock-attribution-summary.txt
- Key Findings:
  - Found 3 CSV files in earnings-analysis/: 8k_fact_universe.csv, predictions_queue.csv, predictions.csv
- Layer 3 Status: Task tool not available; used Glob directly

## Test Architecture Validation

| Layer | Component | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 0 | Main conversation | WORKING | Entry point for skill invocation |
| 1 | mock-orchestrator | WORKING | Successfully coordinated child skills |
| 2 | mock-prediction | WORKING | Completed file search, wrote outputs |
| 2 | mock-attribution | WORKING | Completed file search, wrote outputs |
| 3 | Task subagents | NOT TESTED | Task tool unavailable in forked context |

## Key Observations

1. Skill-to-skill communication works correctly (Layer 1 -> Layer 2)
2. Forked skill execution preserves file system access
3. Both Glob and Write tools available in forked contexts
4. Task tool for spawning subagents not available in forked execution
5. Results properly propagate back to calling layer

## Files Generated by This Test

All files in: /home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/test-outputs/

From Layer 1 (this orchestrator):
- mock-orchestrator-reasoning.txt (pre-execution reasoning)
- mock-orchestrator-final.txt (this file - post-execution summary)

From Layer 2 (child skills):
- mock-prediction-reasoning.txt
- mock-prediction-summary.txt
- mock-attribution-reasoning.txt
- mock-attribution-summary.txt

## Conclusion

The 3-layer test (Main -> Orchestrator -> Child Skills) completed successfully.
Layer 3 (Task subagents) cannot be validated as the Task tool is not available
in forked skill execution contexts. Thinking token capture should be verifiable
at Layers 0, 1, and 2 if the subagent tracking system is functioning correctly.
