MCP_PRELOADED_FROM_PARENT: no | DIRECT_ACCESS: failed

Test Details:
- Skill: test-inherit-child2
- Parent skill: test-inherit-parent2 (HAS mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher in allowed-tools)
- Child skill: Does NOT have MCP tool in allowed-tools

Observation:
The MCP tool mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher is NOT present in my directly
callable functions list. It appears under "Available MCP tools (must be loaded
before use)" in the MCPSearch tool description.

This proves that MCP tools:
1. Are NOT automatically inherited from parent skills
2. Are NOT pre-loaded even when parent has them in allowed-tools
3. MUST be explicitly loaded via MCPSearch before any tool can call them

Conclusion:
MCP tool inheritance does NOT work. Each skill context must independently load
MCP tools via MCPSearch, regardless of parent skill permissions.
