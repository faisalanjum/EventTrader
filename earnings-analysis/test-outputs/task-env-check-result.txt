TEST: task-env-check (forked skill)
TIMESTAMP: 2026-01-25T00:00:00Z

ENVIRONMENT:
CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID: NOT SET

TASK LIST BEFORE:
No tasks found

CREATED TASK:
Subject: "ENV_TEST_FROM_FORK_f7a3b2c9"
Task ID: 1

TASK LIST AFTER:
#1 [pending] ENV_TEST_FROM_FORK_f7a3b2c9

CONCLUSION:
1. CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID environment variable is NOT propagated to forked skill context
2. Despite the missing environment variable, TaskCreate/TaskList tools ARE available and functional
3. Task was successfully created (ID: 1) and appears in the task list
4. This suggests that task tool functionality does NOT depend on the environment variable being set
5. The task system appears to work via a different mechanism (likely internal Claude Code state) rather than relying on environment variables
