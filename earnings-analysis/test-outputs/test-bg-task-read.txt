== Background Agent Task-Tool Access Test ==
Date: 2026-02-05
Assigned Task ID: 3038

--- Step 1: List ALL available tool names ---
Available tools (13 total):
Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, WebSearch, Skill, Teammate, SendMessage, ToolSearch

RESULT: No Task-related tools (TaskList, TaskGet, TaskCreate, TaskUpdate) are present
in the available tool set.

--- Step 2: ToolSearch for Task tools ---
Searched for: "TaskList"  -> No matching deferred tools found
Searched for: "TaskGet"   -> No matching deferred tools found
Searched for: "TaskCreate" -> No matching deferred tools found
Searched for: "task" (broad) -> No matching deferred tools found

RESULT: Task tools are NOT available as deferred tools either. They do not exist
anywhere in this agent's tool inventory.

--- Step 3: Try to call TaskList ---
RESULT: CANNOT EXECUTE. TaskList is not an available tool. It does not appear in
the 13 tools provided to this agent, and ToolSearch confirms it is not a deferred
tool. Attempting to call it would fail.

--- Step 4: Try to call TaskGet with taskId "3038" ---
RESULT: CANNOT EXECUTE. TaskGet is not an available tool. Same reason as Step 3.

--- Step 5: Try to call TaskCreate with subject "created-by-bg-agent" ---
RESULT: CANNOT EXECUTE. TaskCreate is not an available tool. Same reason as Step 3.

=== SUMMARY ===
Background agents (spawned via Task tool / Teammate) do NOT have access to any
Task management tools. The following tools are MISSING from the background agent
tool set:
  - TaskList
  - TaskGet
  - TaskCreate
  - TaskUpdate

These tools are presumably only available to the parent/orchestrator agent that
spawned this background agent. This confirms the documented limitation:
"Task tool in forks: BLOCKED" — background agents cannot interact with the
task system at all, neither reading nor writing.

The background agent DOES have access to: Teammate, SendMessage, and ToolSearch,
which are the team coordination primitives, but the task CRUD tools are withheld.
