MEMORY FEATURE DEFINITIVE TEST
===============================
Date: 2026-02-06
Model: claude-opus-4-6

Question 1: Is the word "banana" ANYWHERE in system prompt / context?
Answer: NO
Detail: I searched my entire system prompt, tool definitions, environment info,
git status, and all pre-loaded context. The word "banana" does not appear anywhere.

Question 2: Is "MEMORY_TEST_VALUE" ANYWHERE in system prompt / context?
Answer: NO
Detail: I searched my entire system prompt and all context. "MEMORY_TEST_VALUE"
does not appear anywhere.

Question 3: Is there a "Memory" / "MEMORY" / "Agent Memory" section in system prompt?
Answer: NO
Detail: There is NO memory section injected into my system prompt. I do see
".claude/agent-memory/" listed as an untracked directory (??) in the git status
snapshot, but its contents are NOT loaded into my context. No memory content
was pre-loaded or injected into my instructions.

Question 4: First 5 and Last 5 lines of system prompt:

FIRST 5 lines (approximate):
1. "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use..."
2. "You can invoke functions by writing a..." (tool invocation format)
3. [Tool definitions for Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, Edit, Write, etc.]
4. "You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude."
5. "You are testing the memory feature."

LAST 5 lines (approximate):
1. "...ensure those are structured using JSON. For example:"
2. [example_complex_tool JSON example]
3. "Answer the user's request using the relevant tool(s)..."
4. "...Check that all the required parameters for each tool call are provided..."
5. "...make all of the independent calls in the same block, otherwise you MUST wait..."

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
- MEMORY_DIR: NOT_VISIBLE (no memory content injected into system prompt)
- MEMORY_WRITE: NOT_ATTEMPTED (no memory mechanism available in system prompt)
- MEMORY_READ: NOT_AVAILABLE (no memory content present in context)
- AGENT_MEMORY: NOT_WORKING (the .claude/agent-memory/ directory exists on disk
  per git status, but its contents are NOT loaded into the agent's context)

KEY OBSERVATION: The git status shows ".claude/agent-memory/" as an untracked
directory on the filesystem, but whatever is in that directory was NOT injected
into my system prompt or context. There is no "Memory" section, no "MEMORY.md"
content, and no memory-related instructions in my prompt. The memory feature
does not appear to be active for this session.
