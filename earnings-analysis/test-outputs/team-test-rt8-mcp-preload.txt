MCP_PRELOAD_FROM_TEAMMATE
skill_invoked: test-re-mcp-preload
skill_completed: YES
mcp_preload_result: NEEDS_TOOLSEARCH
query_result: NOT_EXECUTED (tool unavailable without ToolSearch)
error: NONE

Notes:
- The skill ran successfully in forked context.
- allowed-tools: mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher did NOT pre-load the MCP tool.
- The tool remained deferred and required ToolSearch to be loaded first.
- The Neo4j query "RETURN 1 AS test" was never executed because the tool was not available.
- This confirms: MCP pre-load via allowed-tools does NOT work, even when invoked by a teammate.
