== Background Agent Task Tool Access Test ==
Date: 2026-02-05
Task ID: 3037

STEP 1 — Available Tools:
Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, WebSearch, Skill, Teammate, SendMessage, ToolSearch

Notable ABSENT tools: TaskGet, TaskUpdate, TaskList, TaskCreate

STEP 2 — ToolSearch for "Task":
Result: "No matching deferred tools found"
Task tools are NOT available as deferred tools either.

STEP 3 — TaskGet(taskId="3037"):
BLOCKED — TaskGet is not an available tool. Cannot call it.

STEP 4 — TaskUpdate(taskId="3037", status="in_progress"):
BLOCKED — TaskUpdate is not an available tool. Cannot call it.

STEP 5 — TaskUpdate(taskId="3037", description="UPDATED_BY_BACKGROUND_AGENT"):
BLOCKED — TaskUpdate is not an available tool. Cannot call it.

STEP 6 — TaskList:
BLOCKED — TaskList is not an available tool. Cannot call it.

== SUMMARY ==
Background agents do NOT have access to task management tools (TaskGet, TaskUpdate, TaskList, TaskCreate).
These tools are not in the direct tool list, and ToolSearch finds no deferred versions.
All task operations are BLOCKED for background agents.

The agent DOES have Teammate and SendMessage tools, suggesting it can participate
in team communication but cannot directly manipulate the task list.
