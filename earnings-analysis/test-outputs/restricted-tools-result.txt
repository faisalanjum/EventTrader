# Tool Restriction Test Results

## Test Configuration
- Skill: test-restricted-tools
- Expected restriction: `allowed-tools: Write`
- Test date: 2026-01-16

## Tools Tested and Results

| Tool | Expected | Actual | Result |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Write | ALLOWED | WORKED | As expected |
| Read | BLOCKED | WORKED | NOT RESTRICTED |
| Bash | BLOCKED | WORKED | NOT RESTRICTED |
| Glob | BLOCKED | WORKED | NOT RESTRICTED |
| Grep | BLOCKED | WORKED | NOT RESTRICTED |

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Write Tool
- Status: WORKED
- Evidence: Successfully created this file
- Expected: Should work (explicitly allowed)

### 2. Read Tool
- Status: WORKED
- Evidence: Successfully read this file back after initial creation
- Expected: Should be blocked (not in allowed-tools list)

### 3. Bash Tool
- Status: WORKED
- Evidence: Successfully ran `echo "Bash tool test - $(date)"`
- Output: "Bash tool test - Fri Jan 16 04:37:03 PM EST 2026"
- Expected: Should be blocked (not in allowed-tools list)

### 4. Glob Tool
- Status: WORKED
- Evidence: Successfully listed .txt files in test-outputs directory
- Found 12 .txt files
- Expected: Should be blocked (not in allowed-tools list)

### 5. Grep Tool
- Status: WORKED
- Evidence: Successfully searched for "Tool Restriction" pattern
- Found match in this file
- Expected: Should be blocked (not in allowed-tools list)

## Conclusion

**The `allowed-tools` restriction is NOT being enforced.**

All tools (Write, Read, Bash, Glob, Grep) were accessible and functional despite the skill configuration specifying only `allowed-tools: Write`.

This indicates that:
1. The allowed-tools configuration in skills is either not implemented or not functioning
2. All standard tools remain available regardless of the allowed-tools setting
3. Tool restriction for forked skills/agents needs implementation or debugging

## Recommendation

If tool restriction is a desired security feature for skills/agents, the enforcement mechanism needs to be implemented or fixed in the skill loading/execution layer.
