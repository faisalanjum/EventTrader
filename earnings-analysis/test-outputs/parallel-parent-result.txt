PARALLEL EXECUTION TEST RESULTS
===============================

Test Run: 2026-01-16

TIMESTAMPS
----------
Parent Start (epoch): 1768603785.890658341
Parent End (epoch):   1768603830.340940469
Total Elapsed Time:   44.45 seconds

CHILD EXECUTION TIMESTAMPS
--------------------------
CHILD-A: 2026-01-16 17:50:01.894026234
CHILD-B: 2026-01-16 17:50:16.011

Time difference between child writes: ~14.12 seconds

EXECUTION ANALYSIS
------------------
Both children executed: YES
Execution mode: SEQUENTIAL (not parallel)

Evidence:
- Child A timestamp: 17:50:01.894
- Child B timestamp: 17:50:16.011
- Gap between writes: ~14 seconds

If execution were truly parallel, both timestamps would be within
milliseconds of each other (< 1 second apart). The 14-second gap
indicates that Child B started AFTER Child A completed.

Expected parallel behavior:
- Both skills start simultaneously
- Both write timestamps at nearly the same time
- Both complete after their 2-second wait
- Total time: ~3-5 seconds

Actual sequential behavior:
- Child A started, wrote timestamp, waited 2 seconds, completed
- Child B started AFTER Child A finished
- Child B wrote timestamp, waited 2 seconds, completed
- Total time: ~44 seconds

CONCLUSION
----------
The Skill tool invocations were called in the same message block,
but the underlying execution was SEQUENTIAL. The "forked execution"
mechanism does not provide true concurrent parallel execution of
multiple skills - they are processed one at a time.

Note: Both skills did complete successfully and returned in the
same function_results block, suggesting the parallelism is at
the API call level, not the actual skill execution level.
