TEST: $ARGUMENTS substitution
DATE: 2026-01-16

ARGUMENTS RECEIVED: hello-world test-arg-123

SUBSTITUTION WORKED: YES

EXPLANATION: The skill instructions contained "$ARGUMENTS" as a placeholder, and it was
successfully replaced with the actual arguments passed: "hello-world test-arg-123"

This confirms that:
1. Arguments were passed to the skill via the args parameter
2. The $ARGUMENTS placeholder in the skill content was substituted with the actual values
3. The substitution mechanism is working correctly
