TEST: Subagent as Full Team Leader
DATE: 2026-02-08
METHOD: Primary spawns general-purpose subagent. Subagent creates team, creates task, spawns teammate, receives message, verifies task completion.

SUBAGENT REPORT:
## Subagent Team Leadership Test Report

### 1. TeamCreate: SUCCESS
- Called `TeamCreate` with `team_name: "test-sub-led-team"`, `description: "Team led by a subagent"`.
- Response: Team created successfully. Team file path: `/home/faisal/.claude/teams/test-sub-led-team/config.json`. Lead agent ID: `team-lead@test-sub-led-team`.
- The subagent was able to create a team and was registered as the team lead.

### 2. TaskCreate: SUCCESS
- Called `TaskCreate` with `subject: "SUB-LED-TASK-1"`, `description: "Task created by subagent team leader"`.
- Response: Task #3057 created successfully.
- Task ID: 3057
- The subagent was able to create tasks on the shared task list.

### 3. Teammate Spawn: FAILURE -- Tool Not Available
- The "Task" tool (used to spawn subagent teammates) is not available in this subagent's tool set.
- Searched deferred tools with multiple queries ("spawn teammate subagent task", "task agent spawn create worker") -- no matching tools found.
- The subagent has access to TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList, TaskGet, TeamCreate, TeamDelete, and SendMessage, but does not have the Task tool required to spawn sub-subagents as teammates.
- This means a subagent cannot spawn further nested agents to act as its teammates.

### 4. Message Received from Worker: NO
- No teammate was spawned, so no message was received.

### 5. Task Completed by Worker: NO
- TaskList shows task #3057 still in pending status with no owner.
- No worker existed to claim or complete the task.

### 6. Disk Verification

Team directory (~/.claude/teams/test-sub-led-team/):
- Directory exists with config.json (512 bytes, created at test time).

config.json contents:
{
  "name": "test-sub-led-team",
  "description": "Team led by a subagent",
  "createdAt": 1770568810340,
  "leadAgentId": "team-lead@test-sub-led-team",
  "leadSessionId": "44963e16-c938-4385-871b-02e124241121",
  "members": [
    {
      "agentId": "team-lead@test-sub-led-team",
      "name": "team-lead",
      "agentType": "team-lead",
      "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
      "joinedAt": 1770568810340,
      "tmuxPaneId": "",
      "cwd": "/home/faisal/EventMarketDB",
      "subscriptions": []
    }
  ]
}
- Only one member (the team lead). No worker was added.

Worker file (/home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/test-outputs/test-subagent-team-worker.txt):
- Does not exist. No worker was spawned to write it.

### 7. OVERALL VERDICT: Partial -- Subagent Can Create But Not Staff a Team

A subagent CAN successfully:
- Create a team via TeamCreate (becomes the team lead)
- Create tasks on the shared task list via TaskCreate
- Read/update tasks via TaskList/TaskUpdate
- The team infrastructure (config.json, task directory) is properly created on disk

A subagent CANNOT:
- Spawn teammates (the Task tool for launching sub-subagents is not available to subagents)
- Therefore, it cannot run a full team lifecycle end-to-end

CONCLUSION: Cannot -- A subagent CANNOT lead a full team lifecycle. It can create teams and tasks (administrative functions work), but it lacks the Task tool needed to spawn worker agents. The full lifecycle (create team -> spawn workers -> delegate tasks -> collect results) requires the Task tool, which is not available inside subagents. Only the primary conversation can spawn subagents.
