RT2_PLAN_APPROVAL_TEST
======================
team: test-teams-rt2
date: 2026-02-05

SPAWN PARAMS:
  mode: "plan" passed on Task spawn

PLAN MODE ENFORCEMENT:
  plan_mode_active: YES (confirmed by planner via plan_approval_request)
  write_hard_fail: NO (initial Write succeeded, but system flagged plan mode)
  ExitPlanMode_available: YES
  plan_approval_request_sent: YES
  plan_content_received_by_lead: YES (full markdown plan)
  lead_approval_works: YES (plan_approval_response with approve: true)

KEY FINDING:
  mode: "plan" IS ENFORCED on teammates — this is the FIRST mode parameter
  that actually works (bypassPermissions was ignored in earlier tests).

  Workflow: Teammate plans → ExitPlanMode → lead receives plan_approval_request
  → lead sends plan_approval_response (approve/reject) → teammate continues

CAVEAT:
  Write tool does not hard-fail in plan mode. The planner's initial Write call
  succeeded, but the system then flagged plan mode restrictions via system-reminder.
  This means plan mode is "soft-enforced" — the agent is told to stop, not blocked.
