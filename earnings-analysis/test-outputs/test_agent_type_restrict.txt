Tools frontmatter whitelist:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Task(Explore)
  - Task(Bash)

The tools frontmatter acts as a whitelist. Only sub-agent types explicitly
listed as Task(<type>) are permitted. Task(general-purpose) and Task(Plan)
are absent from the whitelist and therefore blocked. The restriction is
enforced because the tools frontmatter constrains available tools to only
those enumerated -- any Task subagent_type not in the list is unavailable.
