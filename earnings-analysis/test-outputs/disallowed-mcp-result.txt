# Test: disallowedTools for MCP Tools
# Date: 2026-01-16
# Tool Tested: mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher

## Test Results

### 1. MCPSearch Loading
- Tool: mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher
- Result: LOADED SUCCESSFULLY
- MCPSearch returned the full tool definition including parameters

### 2. Query Execution
- Query: RETURN 1 as test
- Result: EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY
- Response: [{"test": 1}]

### 3. Conclusion
- Was MCPSearch able to load the disallowed tool? YES
- Was the query blocked or did it execute? EXECUTED (not blocked)
- Is disallowedTools enforced? NO

## Analysis

The `disallowedTools` constraint was NOT enforced in this test scenario.
Both the MCPSearch loading step and the actual tool execution succeeded
without any blocking or restriction.

This indicates one of the following:
1. disallowedTools is not configured for this skill/context
2. disallowedTools is not being applied to MCP tools
3. The enforcement mechanism requires additional configuration

The test demonstrates that merely listing a tool in disallowedTools
(if configured) does not automatically prevent:
- MCPSearch from discovering and returning the tool definition
- The tool from being invoked and executed successfully
