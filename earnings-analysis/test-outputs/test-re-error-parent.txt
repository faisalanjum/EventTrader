Test: Error Propagation (Parent)
Date: 2026-02-05

1. Did I receive an exception/error object? Or just text?
   Just text. The child skill completed normally and returned a plain text
   response. No exception or error object was thrown or propagated to the
   parent. The Skill tool call returned with a normal "completed" status.

2. What did the child return?
   The child returned the following text string:
   "ERROR_CHILD: Read failed with: File does not exist."

   The child caught the read error internally, formatted it into a text
   message, and returned that message as its normal output. The error did
   not bubble up as a thrown exception to the parent context.

ERROR_PROPAGATION: TEXT_ONLY
