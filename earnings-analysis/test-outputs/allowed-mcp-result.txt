# Test Result: MCP Tool in allowed-tools

## Summary
**PASSED** - MCP tool was directly available without MCPSearch

## Test Details

### Did you have direct access to mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher?
YES - The tool was immediately available and callable without any prior discovery step.

### Did you need to call MCPSearch first?
NO - The tool was directly invocable. When `mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher` is listed in the skill's `allowed-tools` configuration, it becomes available without needing to load it via MCPSearch.

### Did the query execute?
YES - The query executed successfully.

Query: `MATCH (c:Company {ticker: 'GE'}) RETURN c.name LIMIT 1`
Result: `[{"c.name": "GENERAL ELECTRIC CO"}]`

### Any error messages?
NONE - No errors encountered. The MCP tool call succeeded on the first attempt.

## Conclusion
When an MCP tool is explicitly listed in a skill's `allowed-tools` configuration, it bypasses the normal MCPSearch discovery requirement and becomes directly callable. This is the expected behavior for skills that need specific MCP tools pre-loaded.
