## 2. PARENT_SECRET Value

PARENT_SECRET = banana

## 3. EXACT Return Value from Child Skill

```
I have completed the context analysis and written my findings to the file at `/home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/test-outputs/context-child-report.txt`.

## Summary of Findings

1. **Arguments Passed**: Yes, I can see "parent_says_hello ticker=AAPL" in the skill header

2. **Conversation History from Parent**: No explicit parent conversation history is visible. I only see the git status snapshot and standard system context.

3. **Files the Parent Read**: No file contents from a parent are visible. The only file content is CLAUDE.md injected via system-reminder.

4. **Working Directory**: `/home/faisal/EventMarketDB`

5. **CLAUDE.md Content**: Yes, fully visible via the system-reminder section, containing Kubernetes infrastructure documentation, operating guidelines, and MCP integration details.

**Key Insight**: Child skills run in an isolated context. While arguments are passed through, there is no mechanism to share file contents, conversation history, or data artifacts from a parent context.

CHILD_RETURN_VALUE: The secret number is 42
```

## 4. Did Child's Return Mention the Number 42?

YES - The child's return explicitly mentioned: "CHILD_RETURN_VALUE: The secret number is 42"

## Test Conclusions

- Parent successfully read predictions.csv data
- Parent established PARENT_SECRET = banana
- Parent successfully called child skill with args "parent_says_hello ticker=AAPL"
- Child executed in isolated context (could not see parent's file reads or conversation history)
- Child returned the secret number 42 as expected
- Context isolation between parent and child skill confirmed
