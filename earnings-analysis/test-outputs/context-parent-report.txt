## 2. PARENT_SECRET Value

PARENT_SECRET = banana

## 3. EXACT Return Value from Child Skill

```
I have analyzed what context is visible to me as a child skill and written my findings to `/home/faisal/EventMarketDB/earnings-analysis/test-outputs/context-child-report.txt`.

**Summary of Findings:**

1. **Arguments**: YES - I can see "parent_says_hello ticker=AAPL" in the skill header
2. **Conversation history from parent**: NO - I do not see any parent messages or tool calls
3. **Files the parent read**: NO - No Read tool results are visible in my context
4. **Working directory**: /home/faisal/EventMarketDB
5. **CLAUDE.md content**: YES - Full content is visible via system-reminder injection

The child skill runs in a relatively isolated context. I receive the skill arguments and standard system context (CLAUDE.md, env info, git status), but I do not have visibility into the parent's conversation history or any files it may have read.

CHILD_RETURN_VALUE: The secret number is 42
```

## 4. Did Child's Return Mention the Number 42?

YES - The child's return explicitly mentioned: "CHILD_RETURN_VALUE: The secret number is 42"

## Test Conclusions

- Parent successfully read predictions.csv data
- Parent established PARENT_SECRET = banana
- Parent successfully called child skill with args "parent_says_hello ticker=AAPL"
- Child executed in isolated context (could not see parent's file reads or conversation history)
- Child returned the secret number 42 as expected
- Context isolation between parent and child skill confirmed
