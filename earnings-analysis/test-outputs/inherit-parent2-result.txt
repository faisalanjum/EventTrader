TEST: test-inherit-parent2 -> test-inherit-child2
DATE: 2026-01-16
PURPOSE: Test if child skill inherits MCP tool from parent

PARENT SKILL: test-inherit-parent2
- Has mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher in allowed-tools: YES
- Parent loaded MCP tool via MCPSearch: SUCCESS
- Parent can use MCP tool: YES

CHILD SKILL: test-inherit-child2
- Has mcp__neo4j-cypher__read_neo4j_cypher in allowed-tools: NO
- Child attempted direct MCP access: FAILED
- MCP tool appeared in "Available MCP tools (must be loaded before use)"
- Child needed MCPSearch to load before use: YES

RESULT: MCP_PRELOADED_FROM_PARENT: no | DIRECT_ACCESS: failed

CONCLUSION: MCP TOOLS DO NOT PRE-INHERIT FROM PARENT
The child skill (test-inherit-child2) could NOT directly access the MCP tool
that was loaded by its parent skill. The MCP tool was visible in the MCPSearch
description but required explicit loading via MCPSearch before it could be used.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. MCP tools are NOT automatically callable in child contexts
2. MCP tools appear as "Available" but remain deferred
3. Each skill context must independently load MCP tools via MCPSearch
4. Parent's loaded tools do not flow down to child skill execution context

This confirms that MCP tool availability is determined per-context and requires
explicit loading regardless of parent skill permissions.
