The user wants to analyze why a stock moved after an 8-K earnings filing. They've provided an accession number: 0001193125-24-241871.

I have a skill called "earnings-attribution" that is specifically designed for this task - it "Analyzes why stocks moved after 8-K earnings filings."

Let me invoke this skill immediately.

The user wants me to analyze why a stock moved after an 8-K filing with accession number 0001193125-24-241871. I have the earnings-attribution skill which provides a detailed workflow.

Let me follow the 10-step workflow:
1. Data Inventory - Map what data exists
2. Get Report + Returns
3. Get Consensus
4. Query Neo4j (News, Transcript, XBRL history, Dividends, Splits)
5. Query Perplexity
6. Synthesize
7. Output Report
8. Self-Audit
9. Propose Skill Updates
10. Mark Completed

Let me start by creating a todo list and then querying the Neo4j database to understand what data we have for this accession number.

First, I need to read the neo4j_schema.md file to understand the queries I should use.

Now let me read the neo4j_schema.md file to understand the queries, then run the data inventory query.

Now I have the schema reference. Let me first get the report details and understand what company this is for. I'll run a query to get the report by accession number and its returns.

Excellent! This is Greenbrier Companies (GBX), a railroad/industrial company. The stock moved **+16.69%** daily, with a macro-adjusted return of **+16.48%** - a very significant move. Filed post-market on October 23, 2024.

This is an Item 2.02 filing (Results of Operations) - an earnings release. Let me now run the data inventory query to see what other data we have.

Good data availability:
- 5 news items around the filing
- 1 transcript (earnings call)
- 11 XBRL reports for historical context
- No dividends or splits

Let me update the todo and query all the sources.

Excellent! I now have comprehensive data:

**From Perplexity:**
- Consensus EPS: $1.29-1.32 (let me use the news source value of $1.29)
- Consensus Revenue: ~$849.5M - $1.015B (news says $1.015B)
- Actual EPS: $1.92
- Actual Revenue: $1.053B

**From News (Neo4j):**
1. Pre-earnings: Earnings preview mentioning $1.29 EPS estimate
2. Post-earnings: 
   - EPS $1.92 beat $1.29 estimate by 48.84%
   - Sales $1.053B beat $1.015B by 3.79%
   - FY2025 guidance: $3.35B-$3.65B vs $3.63B estimate

**From EX-99.1 Press Release:**
- Q4 Diluted EPS $1.92
- Revenue $1.1B
- Gross margin 18.2%
- EBITDA $159M
- FY2025 Guidance:
  - Revenue: $3.35B - $3.65B
  - Gross Margin: 16.0% - 16.5%

- Operating cash flow $330M for fiscal 2024
- Second-highest EBITDA ever
- Near long-term ROIC target (9.8% vs 10-14% target)

Now I need to get the transcript Q&A and calculate the surprise values.

I now have comprehensive data. Let me synthesize the analysis:

**Key Facts:**
- Filing: 8-K Item 2.02 filed Oct 23, 2024 post-market
- Stock Move: +16.69% (macro-adjusted +16.48%)
- Sector: Industrials, Industry: Railroads

**Surprise Analysis:**

1. **EPS Surprise:**
   - Consensus: $1.29 (Source: Benzinga Earnings Preview, News)
   - Actual: $1.92 (Source: EX-99.1 press release)
   - Surprise: (1.92 - 1.29) / 1.29 × 100 = +48.84%

2. **Revenue Surprise:**
   - Consensus: $1.015B (Source: Benzinga/News post-filing)
   - Actual: $1.053B (Source: EX-99.1)
   - Surprise: (1.053 - 1.015) / 1.015 × 100 = +3.74%

3. **Gross Margin:**
   - Actual: 18.2% (highest in 6+ years per transcript)
   - Previous Q: 15.1%
   - Sequential improvement: +310 bps

4. **FY2025 Revenue Guidance:**
   - Guidance: $3.35B - $3.65B (midpoint: $3.50B)
   - Consensus: $3.63B
   - Surprise: (3.50 - 3.63) / 3.63 × 100 = -3.58%
   - However, margin guidance improved: 16.0%-16.5% vs 15.8% actual FY24

**Primary Driver: MASSIVE EPS BEAT (+48.84%)**

The EPS surprise was the dominant factor:


Remarkable performance highlighted by extraordinary year-over-year growth and operational improvements. Manufacturing efficiency drove significant margin expansion, with gross margin reaching a 6-year peak at 18.2%. Strong cash generation of $330M annually demonstrates robust financial health. The company is nearly two years ahead of its long-term return on invested capital (ROIC) targets, achieving 9.8% against a 10-14% goal by 2026.

Recurring revenue continues robust trajectory, progressing 25% toward strategic doubling objective. A substantial backlog of $3.4B representing 26,700 units underscores strong market positioning. Despite slight revenue guidance variance, investor confidence stems from management's operational excellence, confirmed earnings potential of ~$5 per share, and promising margin expansion projections.
