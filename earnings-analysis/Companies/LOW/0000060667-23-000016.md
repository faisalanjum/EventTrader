## 1. Executive Summary

**Why did LOW stock drop 5.12% (adjusted)?**

**Root Cause: "Beat-and-Lower (Revenue)" Pattern**

- **EPS beat**: Q4 $2.28 vs $2.21 consensus (+3.17% beat)
- **Revenue miss**: Q4 $22.45B vs $22.69B consensus (-1.1% miss)
- **FY23 guidance miss**: Revenue $88-90B vs $90.66B consensus (-1.8% at midpoint)
- **Weak comp outlook**: Flat to -2% comparable sales expected

**The market sold off because Lowe's guided FY23 revenue below Street expectations despite beating Q4 EPS.** Revenue concerns outweighed the earnings beat, with three analysts cutting price targets by 5-9% within 24 hours confirming negative sentiment. The headline explicitly stated: "Slides On Street-Missing FY23 Sales Outlook."

### Why Stock Moved

At market open on March 1, 2023, investors faced a mixed picture:
1. **Positive**: Q4 EPS of $2.28 beat consensus by 3.17%
2. **Negative**: Q4 revenue missed by $240M (-1.1%)
3. **Negative**: FY23 revenue guidance missed by $1.66B at midpoint (-1.8%)
4. **Negative**: Comparable sales outlook of flat to -2% signaled continued weakness

**The forward revenue guidance miss dominated.** The EPS beat was not sufficient to offset concerns about top-line growth in a potentially weakening home improvement market. Three analysts cutting price targets by 5-9% within 24 hours confirmed the negative interpretation.
