# CDLX (Cardlytics) - Company-Specific Learnings

## Driver Sensitivities

| Driver | Typical Impact | Evidence |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **EBITDA turnaround** | Extreme (+78%) | 2024-03-14: First positive annual EBITDA since 2019 drove +78.17% macro-adjusted return |
| **Guidance beats** | High | Q1 revenue guidance +7.58% above consensus contributed to rally |
| **EPS beats** | Medium | +16.67% EPS beat was secondary to EBITDA narrative |
| **Revenue misses** | Low (if immaterial) | -0.43% revenue miss completely ignored |
| **Prior quarter disappointment** | Sets up potential reversal | Previous quarter caused 54% drop; low expectations amplified positive reaction |

## Business Model Notes

- **Industry**: Digital advertising platform (purchase intelligence)
- **Revenue model**: Billings-based (advertisers pay for campaigns), share with bank partners
- **Key metrics**: Billings, MAUs, ARPU, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA
- **Partners**: Major banks (Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America), retailers
- **Fiscal year**: Calendar year (December year-end)

## Valuation Drivers

- **Profitability path**: EBITDA positive/negative is existential for this stock
- **Bank partner additions**: New FI partners = MAU growth = platform value
- **Cost structure**: Partner revenue share renegotiations critical to margins
- **Technology platform**: ADE (Ads Decision Engine) adoption drives engagement lift

## Historical Patterns

| Date | Event | Return | Primary Driver |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 2024-03-14 | Q4 FY2023 8-K | +78.17% | EBITDA turnaround (first positive year since 2019) |

## Management Commentary Patterns

- **Karim Temsamani** (CEO): Strategic vision, platform capabilities, turnaround narrative
- **Alexis DeSieno** (CFO): Financial metrics, capital structure, profitability path

## Analyst Focus Areas

1. EBITDA trajectory and sustainability
2. New bank partner pipeline and timing
3. Capital structure and liquidity
4. ADE technology adoption and engagement metrics
5. Bridge business profitability

## Key Risks to Monitor

- **Bank partner concentration**: Loss of major FI would be devastating
- **SRS-type disputes**: Legal/partner disputes can cause significant overhangs
- **Consumer spending**: Platform depends on consumer purchase activity
- **Advertiser demand**: Cyclical exposure to ad market conditions

## Data Quality Notes

- EPS consensus showed conflict: News ($0.12) vs Perplexity (-$0.47); used News as primary
- EBITDA is the key metric for this company, not EPS
- Billings is the top-line metric that matters more than GAAP revenue
