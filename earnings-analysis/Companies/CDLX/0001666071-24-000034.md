## Executive Summary

Cardlytics surged **+78.17% (macro-adjusted)** following its Q4 FY2023 earnings release. The massive positive reaction was driven by validation of the company's turnaround story:

1. **First positive annual EBITDA since 2019**: FY2023 Adjusted EBITDA of +$3.8M vs -$45.2M in FY2022 (a $49M swing)
2. **Record Q4 EBITDA**: +$10.0M (largest in company history) vs -$6.1M prior year
3. **Strong Q1 guidance**: Revenue guidance of $70-73M beat $66.46M consensus by 7.6%
4. **New bank partner**: Large US financial institution signed, announced same day
5. **Path to sustained profitability**: Q1 expected to be first breakeven Q1 ever

The stock had been under severe pressure (prior quarter miss caused 54% drop), making this turnaround validation especially impactful. Multiple analysts upgraded or raised price targets 50-80% following the release.

## Attribution

### Primary Driver (High Confidence)

**EBITDA Turnaround: First Positive Year Since 2019**

- **What**: Full year Adjusted EBITDA flipped from -$45.2M (FY2022) to +$3.8M (FY2023), a $49M improvement
- **Q4 Specifics**: Record Q4 EBITDA of +$10.0M (vs -$6.1M prior year)
- **Significance**: Validates turnaround thesis after years of losses; proves cost restructuring worked
- **Evidence**:
  - ExhibitContent:EX-99.1: "Adjusted EBITDA: $10.0M" (Q4), "$3.8M" (FY)
  - CFO Alexis DeSieno (ExhibitContent:EX-99.1): "In 2023, we turned to full year positive Adjusted EBITDA for the first time since 2019"
  - Transcript PreparedRemark: "This is the first time since 2019 that we ended the year with positive adjusted EBITDA"

**Why EBITDA > EPS for this stock**: CDLX is a growth company that has been unprofitable for years. The market was pricing in continued losses. Proving they can generate positive EBITDA fundamentally re-rates the stock's viability and multiple.

### Contributing Factor #1 (High Confidence)

**Strong Q1 2024 Guidance**

- **What**: Q1 revenue guidance of $70-73M vs $66.46M consensus (+7.58% above)
- **Additional**: First Q1 EBITDA breakeven expected (-$1M to +$1M)
- **Evidence**: News:bzNews_37718661: "Cardlytics Sees Q1 Revenue $70M-$73M vs $66.46M Est."

### Contributing Factor #2 (High Confidence)

**New Large Bank Partner Signed**

- **What**: Large US financial institution signed as new partner (announced via separate 8-K same day)
- **Impact**: Expands MAU base, validates platform value proposition
- **Evidence**: Transcript Q&A #1 (Kyle Peterson, Needham): CEO confirmed 8-K filing for new bank partner; CFO noted "Full year guidance does not include material impact from new signing"

### Contributing Factor #3 (Medium Confidence)

**Analyst Upgrades and Price Target Raises**

- **Needham**: Maintains Buy, PT raised $12 → $15 (Source: News:bzNews_37739425, 2024-03-15)
- **Craig-Hallum**: Upgraded Hold → Buy, PT raised $10 → $18 (Source: News:bzNews_37754521, 2024-03-15)
- **Lake Street**: Maintains Buy, PT raised $13 → $18 (Source: News:bzNews_37754961, 2024-03-15)

### Non-Driver (Revenue Miss)

- **What**: Q4 Revenue of $89.167M missed $89.551M consensus (-0.43%)
- **Why Not Driver**: Immaterial miss (<0.5%); completely overshadowed by EBITDA turnaround and guidance beat
- **Evidence**: News:bzNews_37717013: "Sales $89.167M Miss $89.551M Estimate"
