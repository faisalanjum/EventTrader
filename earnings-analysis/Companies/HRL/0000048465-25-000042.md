## Executive Summary

Hormel Foods dropped **-13.40% (macro-adjusted)** following its Q3 FY2025 earnings release. The stock reaction was driven by a significant **guidance cut** rather than the quarterly results themselves. While Q3 EPS missed by 14.63%, the forward-looking guidance was the primary concern:

1. **FY2025 Adj EPS guidance cut** from $1.58-$1.68 to $1.43-$1.45 (-10% vs consensus)
2. **Q4 Adj EPS guidance** of $0.38-$0.40 vs $0.48 consensus (-18.75% surprise)
3. **CEO explicitly stated** profit recovery will "lag into next year"
4. **2026 Investor Day targets** effectively reset - management acknowledged assumptions "have not been realized"

The root cause was a **steep, sudden run-up in commodity input costs** (400 bps margin compression), particularly in pork products. Despite strong top-line performance (+6% organic sales, revenue beat), margin compression from inflation overwhelmed operating results.

## Surprise Analysis

| Metric | Consensus | Actual | Surprise % | Rank |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|------|
| Q4 EPS Guidance | $0.48 | $0.39 (midpoint) | **-18.75%** | 1 |
| Q3 EPS | $0.41 | $0.35 | **-14.63%** | 2 |
| FY2025 EPS Guidance | $1.60 | $1.44 (midpoint) | **-10.00%** | 3 |
| Q3 Revenue | $2.98B | $3.032B | **+1.74%** | 4 |

### Surprise Calculations

**Q3 EPS Surprise:**
```
(($0.35 - $0.41) / |$0.41|) × 100 = -14.63%
```

**Q3 Revenue Surprise:**
```
(($3.032B - $2.98B) / |$2.98B|) × 100 = +1.74%
```

**FY2025 Guidance Surprise:**
```
Midpoint: ($1.43 + $1.45) / 2 = $1.44
(($1.44 - $1.60) / |$1.60|) × 100 = -10.00%
```

**Q4 Guidance Surprise:**
```
Midpoint: ($0.38 + $0.40) / 2 = $0.39
(($0.39 - $0.48) / |$0.48|) × 100 = -18.75%
```

## Attribution

### Primary Driver (High Confidence)

**Forward Guidance Cut: FY2025 + Q4 EPS**

- **What**: Management slashed FY2025 Adj EPS guidance from $1.58-$1.68 to $1.43-$1.45, and guided Q4 EPS to $0.38-$0.40 vs $0.48 consensus
- **FY2025 Surprise**: Expected $1.60, Got $1.44 midpoint (-10.00% surprise)
- **Q4 Surprise**: Expected $0.48, Got $0.39 midpoint (-18.75% surprise)
- **Evidence**:
  - News:bzNews_47379385, 2025-08-28: "Lowers FY2025 Adj EPS Guidance from $1.58-$1.68 to $1.43-$1.45 vs $1.60 Est"
  - News:bzNews_47379506, 2025-08-28: "Sees Q4 Adj EPS $0.38-$0.40 vs $0.48 Est"
  - Transcript Q&A: CEO stated profit recovery will "lag into next year"

**Why guidance > EPS miss**: Stocks trade on future earnings. The guidance cut signals:
1. Near-term margin pressure persists through Q4
2. Full-year earnings ~10% below expectations
3. 2026 targets from Investor Day are at risk
4. Pricing actions won't fully offset until FY2026

### Contributing Factor #1 (High Confidence)

**Q3 EPS Miss**

- **What**: Q3 Adj EPS of $0.35 vs $0.41 consensus
- **Surprise**: -14.63%
- **Evidence**: News:bzNews_47379281, 2025-08-28: "Q3 Adj. EPS $0.35 Misses $0.41 Estimate"

### Contributing Factor #2 (High Confidence)

**Commodity Cost Inflation (Root Cause)**

- **What**: Raw material costs compressed margins by ~400 basis points in Q3
- **Details**: Pork bellies +30% YoY, pork cutout +10% YoY, pork trim +20% YoY, beef near all-time highs
- **Evidence**:
  - Transcript PreparedRemark (Jacinthe Smiley): "Approximately 400 basis points in Q3 alone"
  - CEO Jeff Ettinger (News:bzNews_47384524): "The steep rise in commodity input costs was the largest contributor to our shortfall"

### Contributing Factor #3 (Medium Confidence)

**2026 Targets Effectively Reset**

- **What**: Management acknowledged Investor Day 2023 targets were based on assumptions that "have not been realized"
- **Evidence**: Transcript Q&A #5 (Michael Lavery, Piper Sandler): CFO Jacinthe Smiley stated key assumptions changed - "significant commodity inflation, expected strong H2 2025 didn't materialize, consumer is pressured"

### Non-Driver (Revenue Beat)

- **What**: Q3 Revenue of $3.032B beat $2.98B consensus (+1.74%)
- **Why Not Driver**: Positive surprise was overwhelmed by margin compression; "top-line growth not translating to bottom line" was the market's takeaway
- **Evidence**: President John Ghingo (News:bzNews_47384524): "The gap between this performance and our profitability is not the outcome we were aiming for"
