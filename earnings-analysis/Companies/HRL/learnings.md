# HRL (Hormel Foods) - Company-Specific Learnings

## Driver Sensitivities

| Driver | Typical Impact | Evidence |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Guidance cuts** | High (-10% to -15%) | 2025-08-27: FY2025 guidance cut drove -13.40% macro-adjusted return |
| **Commodity inflation** | High (margin compression) | 400 bps margin impact in Q3 FY2025 from pork/beef inflation |
| **EPS miss** | Medium | -14.63% EPS surprise contributed but guidance was primary |
| **Revenue beat** | Low (doesn't offset margin issues) | +1.74% revenue beat was overwhelmed by margin compression |

## Key Cost Drivers

- **Pork bellies**: Major input cost, highly volatile (30% YoY swing observed)
- **Pork cutout**: Secondary pork input
- **Pork trim**: Used in processed products
- **Beef**: Near all-time highs as of Q3 FY2025

## Business Model Notes

- **Fiscal year**: October year-end (FY2024 ended 2024-10-27)
- **Industry**: PackagedFoods
- **Key brands**: Skippy, Planters (acquired), turkey products
- **Pricing power**: Limited in current environment; must balance consumer elasticity and brand health
- **Pass-through lag**: Food service pricing catches up eventually; retail takes longer

## Historical Patterns

| Date | Event | Return | Primary Driver |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 2025-08-27 | Q3 FY2025 8-K | -13.40% | FY2025 guidance cut + commodity inflation |

## Management Commentary Patterns

- **Jeff Ettinger** (Interim CEO): Direct about shortfalls, emphasizes long-term strategy
- **John Ghingo** (President): Operational focus, detailed on pricing and cost dynamics
- **Jacinthe Smiley** (CFO): Technical on commodity exposure, Transform & Modernize program

3. 2026 Investor Day targets validity
4. Double-digit operating margin target
5. Turkey business seasonality (Thanksgiving)
