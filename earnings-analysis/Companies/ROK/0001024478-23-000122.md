## 1. Executive Summary

**Why did ROK stock drop 5.06% (adjusted)?**

**Root Cause: "Beat-and-Lower" Pattern**

- Q4 FY2023 EPS of $3.64 beat consensus estimate of $3.45 by 5.5%
- FY2024 Guidance midpoint of $12.75 was 3.6% below Street estimate of $13.22
- Organic sales guidance of -2% to +4% signaled significant deceleration from FY23's +17%

The market's negative reaction was driven by the guidance disappointment overshadowing the earnings beat, compounded by concerns about order weakness (Q4 orders hit trough) and China exposure.

RETURN r, c, pf
```

**Key Data Retrieved**:

### Step 4: Extract Key Facts from Prepared Remarks

**A. FY2023 Performance (Beat)**:
- Total sales: $9.1B (+17% YoY organic)
- Adjusted EPS: $12.12 (+28% YoY)
- Q4 EPS: $3.64 (record quarter, +20% YoY)
- Free cash flow: $1.2B (86% conversion)
- Segment margin: 21.3% (+140bps YoY)

**B. FY2024 Guidance (Miss)**:
- Total sales: ~$9.4B (0.5% to 6.5% growth)
- **Organic sales: -2% to +4%** (vs FY23's +17%)
- Segment margin: ~21.5% (up slightly)
- **Adjusted EPS: $12.00 to $13.50** (midpoint $12.75 vs $13.22 consensus)

**C. Order Concerns**:
- FY23 orders: $8.2B
- Q4 orders hit TROUGH (lowest of the year)
- FY24 orders expected: Low single-digit growth
- Book-to-bill for FY24: ~0.9x
- Backlog: $4.1B (down from peak, still above pre-pandemic)

**D. China Exposure**:
- China = 6% of sales
- Seeing "high order deferrals and cancellations in China"
- Distributor inventory high, working through backlog

**E. ClearPath Acquisition Drag**:
- Expected to reduce FY24 EPS by $0.25
- Won't be accretive until FY26

---

### Step 5: Extract Key Insights from Q&A

**Analyst Concern #1: Order Weakness (Julian Mitchell, Barclays)**
> "Book to bill will be about 0.9 times? Is that correct?"
> **CFO**: "Yeah, your math is right. Approximately 90% book-to-bill for the full year, below that in the first half of the year."

**Analyst Concern #2: Revenue Outlook Skepticism (Julian Mitchell)**
> "Is it just that the pace of these onshore and stimulus projects is so much slower than perhaps people often hope or assume?"
> **CEO**: "We're still in the early innings there...by far there's more business to come."

**Analyst Concern #3: Backlog Decline (Nigel Coe, Wolf Research)**
> "The 0.9 times book to bill for the full year seems to suggest that we're going to be down sort of the lowest $3 billion for the backlog by end of 2024."

**Analyst Concern #4: ClearPath Dilution (Steve Tusa, JPMorgan)**
> "The 25 cents of acquisition headwind is pretty big...given it's a relatively small revenue number."
> **CEO**: "This is an important strategic move for Rockwell...we expect ClearPath to be accretive in fiscal year 26."

**Analyst Concern #5: Incentive Comp Math (Steve Tusa)**
- FY23 bonus expense: $240M
- FY24 bonus expense: $120M (tailwind of $0.85 to EPS)
- This means underlying business performance needs to decline for EPS to stay in range

## 3. Attribution Summary

### Primary Driver (70% weight)
**Guidance Disappointment**
- FY24 EPS midpoint of $12.75 is 3.6% below consensus $13.22
- Organic sales guidance of -2% to +4% represents massive deceleration from +17% in FY23
- Implies potential for negative organic growth (unprecedented in recent history)

### Secondary Driver (20% weight)
**Order Concerns & Backlog Normalization**
- Q4 orders hit trough level
- Book-to-bill of 0.9x suggests backlog erosion
- Distributor destocking expected to continue through Q1

### Tertiary Driver (10% weight)
**China Weakness & Acquisition Dilution**
- High cancellations in China (6% of sales)
- ClearPath acquisition creating $0.25 EPS drag in FY24

## 5. Schema Implications for Automation

### Current Schema Gaps Identified

1. **No Guidance Nodes**: Earnings guidance (EPS, revenue ranges) not stored as structured nodes
2. **No Estimate Nodes**: Analyst consensus estimates not linked to reports
3. **No XBRL Facts Linked**: This 8-K has no XBRL nodes connected (data extraction needed)
4. **No DRIVER Nodes**: Attribution analysis not stored in graph

### Proposed New Node Types

```
(:Guidance {
  eps_low: 12.00,
  eps_high: 13.50,
  eps_midpoint: 12.75,
  revenue_low: 9.25B,
  revenue_high: 9.55B,
  organic_growth_low: -2%,
  organic_growth_high: 4%,
  fiscal_year: 2024
})-[:ANNOUNCED_IN]->(:Report)

(:Estimate {
  eps_consensus: 13.22,
  revenue_consensus: 9.4B,
  source: 'Street',
  as_of_date: '2023-11-01'
})-[:APPLIES_TO]->(:Company)

(:Driver {
  type: 'Guidance Miss',
  magnitude: -3.6%,
  weight: 0.70,
  description: 'FY24 EPS midpoint below consensus'
})-[:ATTRIBUTED_TO]->(:Report)
```

### Automation Workflow Recommendation

1. **Perplexity SEC Search** → Get official 8-K filing content and analyst estimates
2. **Perplexity Web Search** → Get analyst reactions and real-time sentiment
3. **Neo4j Transcript Query** → Get management commentary and analyst concerns
4. **LLM Attribution** → Synthesize drivers with weights
5. **Store in Graph** → Create DRIVER nodes linked to Report

## 7. Validation Notes

**Stock Price Movement**:
- Hourly adjusted return: -3.09% (first hour after 8-K filing)
- Daily adjusted return: -5.06% (market-adjusted, direction continued)
- Pattern: Initial drop intensified through the day (classic "beat-and-lower" reaction)

**News-Transcript Alignment**:
- News teaser at 07:06 showed guidance range ($12.00-$13.50)
- Transcript at 08:30 confirmed this guidance with detailed segment breakdown
- Sources are consistent and mutually reinforcing

---

## 8. Point-in-Time Analysis (No Hindsight)

**Constraint**: Only data available by market close on Nov 2, 2023.

### Timeline of Information Release

| Time | Event | Key Data |
|------|-------|----------|
| 07:03 AM | Earnings news | EPS $3.64 vs $3.45 est (+5.5% beat) |
| 07:04 AM | 8-K filed | Item 2.02 Results of Operations |
| 07:06 AM | Guidance news | FY24 EPS $12.00-$13.50 vs $13.22 est |
| 08:30 AM | Earnings call | Book-to-bill 0.9x, China cancellations |
| 04:00 PM | Market close | Stock -5.06% adjusted |

### Analyst Concerns (from Q&A, same day)

| Analyst | Firm | Concern | Management Response |
|---------|------|---------|---------------------|
| Julian Mitchell | Barclays | Book-to-bill 0.9x? | CFO: "Yes, approximately 90%" |
| Scott Davis | Milius | China cancellations | CEO: "6% of sales, highest cancellations" |
| Nigel Coe | Wolf | Backlog to $3B? | CFO: "Normalizing to 30-35% of revenue" |

### Why Stock Fell Despite Beat

Market prices the **future**, not the past:
- **Past** (Q4 beat): +5.5% EPS beat → Already in the stock
- **Future** (FY24 guidance): -3.6% below consensus → Drives repricing

The -3.09% hourly drop ≈ guidance miss magnitude (-3.6%), confirming guidance as primary driver. Additional -2% through the day reflects Q&A concerns (orders, China).

### External Data Required

None. Neo4j contained all necessary data:
- News: Beat/miss numbers, guidance range, consensus estimate
- Transcript: Management commentary, analyst concerns
- Report: Filing timestamp, returns

Perplexity fallback would only be needed if consensus estimate was missing from news headlines.
