## Executive Summary

**Why did GBX stock rise +20.64% (adjusted)?**

Greenbrier delivered a massive EPS beat (+59% vs consensus) driven by exceptional margin performance (18% gross margin for the 7th consecutive quarter above target), while simultaneously raising full-year margin guidance. The profitability story dominated despite a slight revenue miss (-4.8%), as investors rewarded operational execution and cash flow generation (~$140M) in a challenging freight environment.

## Surprise Analysis

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Surprise |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| EPS | $1.17 | $1.86 | **+58.97% beat** |
| Revenue | $885.61M | $842.7M | -4.84% miss |
| Gross Margin Guidance | 17.0%-17.5% | 17.7%-18.3% | **+70-80bps raise** |
| Operating Margin Guidance | 10.2%-10.7% | 10.6%-11.0% | +40bps raise |

**Note on Consensus Conflict:** News headline (Benzinga) reported EPS estimate of $0.98 and revenue estimate of $785.72M, which would imply an 89.8% EPS beat and 7.2% revenue beat. Perplexity's multi-source consensus ($1.17 EPS, $885.61M revenue) was used as primary given stronger provenance.

## Attribution

### Primary Driver
**Massive EPS Beat + Margin Guidance Raise**
- **Surprise**: Expected $1.17 EPS, Got $1.86 (+59% beat); Raised gross margin guidance by 70-80bps
- **Evidence**:
  - "Net earnings attributable to Greenbrier of $60 million, or $1.86 per diluted share" (Source: 8-K EX-99.1, 2025-07-01)
  - "Aggregate gross margin of 18%; Seventh consecutive quarter meeting or exceeding mid-teens gross margin goal" (Source: 8-K EX-99.1)
  - "Raises FY25 margin guidance; Affirms outlook on deliveries and revenue" (Source: 8-K EX-99.1 headline)
- **Why it matters**: Investors focused on profitability execution rather than top-line growth. The +59% EPS beat demonstrates pricing power and operational leverage. Raising margin guidance signals confidence in sustained profitability despite softer demand environment.

### Contributing Factors

**1. Strong Operating Cash Flow**
- **Evidence**: "Operating cash flow of nearly $140 million reflecting increased earnings and working capital efficiencies" (Source: 8-K EX-99.1)
- **Impact**: Demonstrates quality of earnings and capital discipline

**2. Analyst Upgrade**
- **Evidence**: "Susquehanna analyst Bascome Majors maintains Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX) with a Positive and raises the price target from $52 to $57" (Source: News, 2025-07-02)
- **Impact**: Validated the earnings beat narrative on the following trading day

**3. Strong Backlog + Fleet Utilization**
- **Evidence**: "New railcar backlog of 18,900 units with an estimated value of $2.5 billion" and "Strong lease fleet utilization of 98%" (Source: 8-K EX-99.1)
- **Impact**: Provided visibility into future revenue despite current quarter miss

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Reasoning**:
- Multiple sources agree on the EPS beat magnitude (+59% using Perplexity consensus)
- Clear causal link: earnings beat + margin guidance raise = stock up 21%
- The primary driver (EPS beat + margin story) explains the direction and magnitude
- Forward guidance raise is typically a stronger driver than backward-looking beat alone
- **Caveats**: Consensus sources conflicted (News: $0.98 EPS vs Perplexity: $1.17 EPS). Using Perplexity's $1.17 as more credible given multi-source attribution; both scenarios still show massive beat.
- No transcript available to confirm management tone or analyst Q&A reactions

## Historical Context (for future analyses)

**What moves GBX stock:**
- **Margin performance is key**: This is a margin story, not a revenue story. GBX trades on profitability execution. Seven consecutive quarters of 18%+ gross margin built credibility.
- **Guidance raises matter more than beats**: The raised margin guidance (not just the beat) likely drove the outsized reaction.
- **Railcar demand is cyclical but backlog provides visibility**: $2.5B backlog offers 12+ months of visibility even if new orders slow.

**Company-specific sensitivities:**
- Gross margin vs mid-teens target (current: 18% for 7 consecutive quarters)
- Operating cash flow generation
- Backlog levels and book-to-bill ratio
- European footprint optimization (cost savings story ongoing)

**Watch for next quarter:**
- Can they sustain 18% gross margin?
- Book-to-bill ratio (3,900 orders vs 5,600 deliveries = 0.7x this quarter)
- Progress on $10M+ annual savings from European plant closure
