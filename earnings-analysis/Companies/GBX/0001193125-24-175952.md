## Attribution

### Primary Driver
**Revenue Miss (-11.68%)**
- Surprise: Expected $928.7M, Got $820.2M (-$108.5M shortfall)
- Evidence: News headline "Sales $820.200M Miss $928.733M Estimate" (2024-07-08); 8-K EX-99.1 cites "timing of new railcar deliveries" as cause
- Why it matters: Revenue is the primary indicator of top-line momentum. An 11.68% miss signals demand or execution issues regardless of margin improvements. Markets penalize revenue misses heavily, especially when guidance is also cut.

### Contributing Factor(s)

**EPS Miss (-7.83%)**
- Evidence: News headline "GAAP EPS $1.06 Misses $1.15 Estimate" (2024-07-08)
- Impact: Amplified the negative reaction. Despite being the highest EPS in 4.5 years, missing consensus by nearly 8% reinforced concerns about execution.

**FY24 Guidance Cut**
- Evidence: News headline "Revised FY24 Revenue Outlook To $3.5B-$3.6B (From $3.5B-$3.7B Prior) Vs $3.56B Est." (2024-07-08)
- Impact: Narrowing guidance by eliminating the $3.7B high-end scenario signals management expects lower deliveries than previously anticipated. The new midpoint ($3.55B) is below consensus ($3.56B).

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Reasoning**:
- Multiple sources agree: News headlines and 8-K filing both confirm the miss figures
- Clear fundamental driver: Revenue shortfall of -11.68% is large and unambiguous
- Guidance cut provides independent confirmation of reduced expectations
- Transcript shows management acknowledged timing issues (changeovers, border delays)
- No conflicting narratives - all sources point to revenue disappointment as the driver

**Caveats**:
- Slight discrepancy in EPS consensus: Perplexity reported $1.08, News headline showed $1.15. Used News headline ($1.15) as it's from day-of-filing data provider with higher reliability for real-time estimates.

## Historical Context (for future analyses)

**What moves GBX stock:**
1. **Revenue is paramount**: Despite achieving record EPS and EBITDA (highest in 4.5 years), the 11.68% revenue miss dominated the reaction. GBX investors prioritize top-line growth over margin expansion.

2. **Delivery timing matters**: Management attributed the revenue shortfall to "timing of new railcar deliveries" and production line changeovers. In railcar manufacturing, quarterly delivery timing can swing results significantly.

3. **Guidance direction**: Narrowing guidance (cutting the high end) is interpreted as a negative signal even when the low end is maintained.

4. **Forward indicators to watch**:
   - Backlog units and value
   - Delivery guidance for upcoming quarters
   - Production line changeover schedules
   - Lease fleet growth and utilization

**Company-specific sensitivities**:
- High sensitivity to revenue vs expectations (trumps profitability metrics)
- Cyclical railcar demand creates volatility in order cadence
- Management indicated FY2025 will be "in the neighborhood" of FY2024 - flat growth expectation
