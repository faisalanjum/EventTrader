## Attribution

### Primary Driver
**Massive Revenue Beat (+40.6%)**
- Surprise: Expected $782.27M, Got ~$1.1B (+$318M)
- Evidence: News headline "Greenbrier Expects Q2 Revenue Of $1.1B Vs $782.27M Estimate" (Source: News, 2023-03-22T06:11:24)
- Why it matters: Revenue exceeded expectations by over 40%, demonstrating significantly stronger demand for railcar manufacturing and services than the Street anticipated. This suggests analysts severely underestimated Greenbrier's execution and market position.

### Contributing Factor #1
**EPS Beat (+170.8%)**
- Surprise: Expected $0.36 GAAP, Got $0.95-$1.00 GAAP
- Evidence: News headline "GAAP EPS Of $0.95-$1.00 Vs $0.36 Estimate" (Source: News, 2023-03-22T06:11:24); EX-99.1 confirms "GAAP EPS of $0.95 to $1.00 per share"
- Impact: The EPS beat amplified the positive signal from revenue, showing the company not only grew sales but maintained or improved profitability.

### Contributing Factor #2
**Strong Order Activity**
- Evidence: "Orders for 4,500 new railcars with an aggregate value of $580 million during its fiscal second quarter" (Source: 8-K EX-99.1, 2023-03-22)
- Impact: Forward-looking demand indicator that reinforced the beat narrative and provided visibility into future quarters.

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Reasoning**:
- News headline explicitly provides consensus estimates and actual figures, enabling precise surprise calculations
- 8-K EX-99.1 press release confirms all reported figures
- Both revenue and EPS beats are directionally consistent with the +8.46% macro-adjusted move
- No conflicting information across sources
- The magnitude of the beats (40.6% revenue, 170.8% EPS) clearly explains a high single-digit stock move

**Caveats**:
- EPS consensus of $0.36 seems unusually low compared to Perplexity's mention of ~$0.99 adjusted EPS estimates. The news explicitly states $0.36 was the estimate vs GAAP EPS - possible the Street had very conservative GAAP estimates due to expected one-time items
- This was a preliminary release; full Q2 results were scheduled for April 10

## Historical Context (for future analyses)

**Key Learnings for GBX:**
1. **Revenue beats drive the stock**: A 40%+ revenue beat correlated with 8%+ macro-adjusted move
2. **Manufacturing/order activity matters**: Strong new orders ($580M) provided forward visibility that reinforced the beat
3. **Preliminary releases can move stock**: Even without full financials, preliminary results with specific guidance moved the stock significantly
4. **Fiscal calendar**: GBX fiscal year ends in August; Q2 ends in February. March filings cover Q2 results
5. **Industry cyclicality**: Railcar manufacturing is tied to broader freight/industrial activity - monitor for macro sensitivity

**Watch for Next Time:**
- Revenue vs consensus (threshold: ±5% typically moves stock)
- New orders and backlog trends
- Delivery guidance vs capacity
- Freight market indicators
