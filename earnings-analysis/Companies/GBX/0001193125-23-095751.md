## Executive Summary

**Why did GBX stock rise +10.02% (macro-adjusted)?**

Greenbrier delivered a massive earnings beat with adjusted EPS of $0.99 vs $0.36 consensus (+175% surprise) and revenue of $1.12B vs $782M expected (+43% surprise). The beat was driven by a 69% sequential increase in railcar deliveries (7,600 vs 4,500 units), robust syndication activity in the leasing segment, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. FY23 guidance was in-line with expectations, so the move was entirely attributable to the backward-looking operational outperformance.

## Surprise Analysis

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Surprise |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| EPS (Adjusted) | $0.36 | $0.99 | **+175.00%** beat |
| Revenue | $782.27M | $1,122.0M | **+43.43%** beat |
| FY23 Revenue Guidance | $3.41B | $3.55B (midpoint) | +4.1% above |

**Calculation Notes:**
- EPS Surprise = (($0.99 - $0.36) / |$0.36|) × 100 = +175.00%
- Revenue Surprise = (($1,122.0M - $782.27M) / |$782.27M|) × 100 = +43.43%
- Guidance Surprise = (($3,550M - $3,410M) / |$3,410M|) × 100 = +4.11%

## Attribution

### Primary Driver
**Massive EPS Beat (+175%)**
- Surprise: Expected $0.36, delivered $0.99 (adjusted)
- Evidence: News headline "Q2 Adjusted EPS $0.99 May Not Be Compared To $0.36 Estimate" (Source: News, 2023-04-10 06:05:26); confirmed in 8-K EX-99.1
- Why it matters: The magnitude of the EPS beat (175%) is extraordinary and represents the single largest contributor to the stock reaction. The market was expecting near-breakeven results and received nearly $1 in EPS.

### Contributing Factor 1
**Revenue Beat (+43%)**
- Evidence: News headline "Sales $1.12B Beat $782.27M Estimate" (Source: News, 2023-04-10 06:05:26)
- Impact: Revenue 43% above expectations amplified the EPS beat, demonstrating operational strength rather than just margin improvement. Manufacturing revenue of $968.6M was up 50% sequentially from $646.5M in Q1.

### Contributing Factor 2
**Increased Railcar Deliveries (+69% sequential)**
- Evidence: "Deliveries of 7,600 units" vs Q1's 4,500 units (Source: 8-K EX-99.1, 2023-04-10)
- Impact: The delivery surge plus timing of syndication activity explains the revenue beat. Per the CEO: "Greenbrier's strong performance in the second quarter is the result of ongoing operational initiatives and robust syndication activity."

### Contributing Factor 3
**Raised FY23 Guidance**
- Evidence: News "Greenbrier Expects FY23 Revenue Of $3.4B–$3.7B Vs. Consensus Of $3.41B" (Source: News, 2023-04-10 06:09:59)
- Impact: Guidance midpoint of $3.55B slightly above consensus (+4.1%) reinforced the positive narrative but was not the primary driver. Guidance was characterized as "raised" from prior expectations.

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Reasoning**:
- **Multiple sources agree**: The 8-K press release (EX-99.1) and news headlines independently confirm the same EPS ($0.99) and revenue ($1.12B) figures
- **Consensus sourced from news headline**: The estimate values ($0.36 EPS, $782M revenue) come directly from a news headline that explicitly cites analyst estimates. While not from a primary pre-filing source, the headline format is consistent with earnings announcement coverage
- **Clear causal link**: The 175% EPS beat and 43% revenue beat are of sufficient magnitude to explain a +10% move; no conflicting narratives emerged
- **Guidance not the driver**: FY23 guidance was only marginally above consensus (+4.1%), confirming the move was primarily about backward-looking results

**Caveats**:
- The news headline notes "May Not Be Compared" regarding EPS, suggesting possible comparability issues with prior estimates (likely due to Q1's impairment charges or Gunderson exit costs)
- No transcript available to assess management tone or analyst concerns
- Perplexity did not return pre-filing consensus; relied on news headline as consensus source

## Historical Context (for future analyses)

**What moves GBX stock:**
1. **Delivery volumes are critical**: The 69% sequential increase in deliveries drove both revenue and EPS beats. Future analyses should focus on delivery guidance vs consensus
2. **Syndication timing matters**: "Robust syndication activity" was cited multiple times as a driver. This creates quarter-to-quarter volatility
3. **Manufacturing margins**: Improvement from 6.5% to 7.0% contributed to EPS leverage. Watch for margin guidance
4. **Backlog provides visibility**: $3.1B backlog (25,900 units) provides 2+ years of visibility; changes to backlog could be forward indicators
5. **Leasing segment amplifies results**: Leasing & Management Services margin jumped from 62.6% to 74.0% due to syndication timing

**Post-filing activity (from news):**
- April 11: Stephens raised PT to $38, BofA raised PT to $35 (maintained Underperform)
- April 12: Investor Day held; company set multi-year margin targets
- April 12-14: Stock gave back some gains (-5% on April 12)
