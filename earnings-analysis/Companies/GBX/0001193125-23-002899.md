## Executive Summary

**Why did GBX stock drop -20.08% (adjusted)?**

Greenbrier reported a massive EPS miss of -90% ($0.05 adjusted vs $0.50 consensus), driven by persistent supply chain issues, margin compression, and a $24.2M impairment charge from closing its Portland manufacturing facility. Despite beating revenue estimates by 2.6% and maintaining FY23 guidance, the market punished the stock severely as the earnings shortfall signaled deeper operational challenges than expected, with management revising earnings cadence from 40/60 to 25/75 H1/H2 split.

## Attribution

### Primary Driver
**Massive EPS Miss (-90%)**
- Surprise: Expected $0.50 EPS, Got $0.05 = -90% miss
- Evidence: "Adjusted EPS of $0.05 missed the consensus of $0.50" (Source: News:bzNews_30307845, 2023-01-06)
- Why it matters: A 90% EPS miss is catastrophic regardless of top-line performance. The adjusted EPS of $0.05 versus $0.50 consensus represents a fundamental breakdown in the company's ability to convert revenue growth into profit. Revenue grew 39% YoY ($766.5M vs $550.7M in Q1 FY2022) but EPS collapsed from $0.32 to $0.05 (adjusted) or -$0.51 (GAAP).

### Contributing Factor(s)

**Supply Chain Margin Pressure**
- Evidence: "Manufacturing margins were impacted by higher costs for outsourced parts, material shortages, supplier issues and lingering supply chain complications" (Source: Report:0001193125-23-002899/EX-99.1, CEO Commentary)
- Impact: Gross margin of 9.1% was below expectations. Management noted supply chain pressure "increased as Greenbrier and other manufacturers ramped production" - unlike most industries seeing easing post-COVID. (Source: Transcript Q&A #1)

**Portland Facility Closure & Impairment**
- Evidence: $24.2M pre-tax ($18M after-tax, $0.56/share) non-cash impairment charge for ceasing railcar manufacturing at Portland (Source: Report:0001193125-23-002899/EX-99.1)
- Impact: Signals operational challenges and strategic retreat, adding to concerns about execution. The impairment explains the gap between adjusted EPS ($0.05) and GAAP EPS (-$0.51).

**Earnings Cadence Shift**
- Evidence: "The split should now be viewed as 25%/75% given Q1 performance" (previously 40/60 H1/H2) (Source: Transcript Q&A #15, Steve Barger/KeyBank)
- Impact: Indicates Q1 weakness is structural, not temporary. Investors must wait longer for earnings recovery, increasing uncertainty.

| Transcript | Used | 9.1% gross margin; Portland closure rationale; 25/75 earnings cadence; analyst concerns about supply chain |

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Reasoning**:
- Multiple sources confirm the 90% EPS miss as the dominant driver (EX-99.1 press release, News headlines, Transcript)
- The magnitude of the surprise (-90%) clearly explains the -17.88% stock drop
- Revenue beat (+2.6%) and guidance in-line/slightly above show this was purely an earnings story
- Transcript Q&A confirms analyst focus was on margin disappointment and supply chain issues
- No conflicting narratives - all sources point to the same conclusion

**Caveats**:
- Perplexity API was unavailable; consensus sourced from News headlines (bzNews_30307845) published same day as filing
- News consensus may be post-filing reporting of actual vs estimate rather than pre-filing analyst consensus, though the article explicitly cites "consensus" figures

## Historical Context (for future analyses)

**Company-Specific Learnings for GBX:**

1. **Margin sensitivity**: GBX stock is highly sensitive to margin performance even when revenue beats. The 39% YoY revenue growth was completely overshadowed by margin compression.

2. **Supply chain exposure**: As a railcar manufacturer with significant outsourced components, GBX has elevated supply chain risk. Watch for: fabrication insourcing progress (expected ~200bps improvement), Mexican operations (rail congestion mentioned).

3. **Earnings cadence matters**: Management providing H1/H2 earnings split guidance creates expectations. When Q1 performance forces a revision (40/60 to 25/75), market reacts negatively even if full-year guidance maintained.

4. **Backlog provides floor, not catalyst**: Strong backlog (28,300 units/$3.4B) and book-to-bill (1.2x) weren't enough to offset earnings miss. Backlog is "priced in" - execution is what matters.

5. **Adjusted vs GAAP clarity**: GBX reports adjusted EPS excluding impairments. For this quarter, the $0.56/share gap between adjusted ($0.05) and GAAP (-$0.51) was significant. Track impairment charges as potential red flags.

**Watch Next Time**:
- Gross margin vs 9.1% (this quarter) and low-double-digit target
- Fabrication insourcing completion (expected Q4 FY2023)
- Supply chain commentary - improving or still pressured?
- Portland closure completion and marine business strategic review
- Earnings cadence - any revision to 25/75 split?
