## Executive Summary

**Why did GBX stock drop -20.08% (adjusted)?**

Greenbrier's stock collapsed despite a revenue beat because adjusted EPS of $0.05 missed the $0.50 consensus by 90%, driven by severe manufacturing margin compression (6.5% vs 10.3% prior quarter) from supply chain disruptions and a $24M impairment charge from the announced closure of its Portland, Oregon railcar manufacturing facility. The market reacted to margin deterioration and restructuring concerns, ignoring the positive book-to-bill ratio and maintained guidance.

## Surprise Analysis

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Surprise |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Adjusted EPS | $0.50 | $0.05 | **-90.00%** (miss) |
| Revenue | $747.08M | $766.5M | +2.60% (beat) |
| FY23 Revenue Guidance | $3.33B | $3.4B (midpoint) | +2.10% (in-line/slight beat) |
| Manufacturing Margin | ~10% (prior Q) | 6.5% | -370 bps (deterioration) |

## Attribution

### Primary Driver
**Massive Adjusted EPS Miss (-90%)**
- Surprise: Expected $0.50, Got $0.05 (90% miss)
- Evidence: "Greenbrier Companies Q1 EPS $0.05 May Not Compare to $0.50 Estimate" (Source: Benzinga News, 2023-01-06 06:01)
- Why it matters: A 90% EPS miss signals fundamental operational problems. The delta of $0.45/share was driven entirely by margin collapse, not revenue shortfall.

### Contributing Factor 1
**Portland Facility Closure & Impairment Charge**
- Evidence: "Ceasing railcar manufacturing at Portland, Oregon facility following completion of current production commitment... resulting in a non-cash charge of $24 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets" (Source: 8-K EX-99.1, 2023-01-06)
- Impact: The $0.56/share after-tax charge turned a marginal profit into a GAAP loss of -$0.51/share. More importantly, it signaled structural problems in the manufacturing footprint requiring strategic restructuring.

### Contributing Factor 2
**Manufacturing Margin Collapse**
- Evidence: "Gross margin impacted by increased costs related to outsourced components, material shortages, supplier issues and other supply chain complications" (Source: 8-K EX-99.1, 2023-01-06)
- Manufacturing margin dropped from 10.3% (Q4 FY22) to 6.5% (Q1 FY23) = 370 bps compression
- Management stated margin recovery expected via "insourcing vital components" but not until Q4 FY23
- CEO (Transcript): "we would expect this to be probably a couple hundred basis points of margin impact as we move through the fiscal year associated with supply chain"

### Mitigating Factors (Why move wasn't larger)
**Maintained Guidance + Strong Order Activity**
- Book-to-bill of 1.2x with $3.4B backlog provided confidence in demand
- Guidance range of $3.2B-$3.6B maintained (slightly above consensus)
- Lease fleet utilization at 98% showed strength in leasing segment

## Data Sources Used

| Source | Status | Key Finding |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Report/Returns | Used | Pre-market 8-K with -20% macro-adj return |
| News (5 items) | Used | Pre-filing consensus of $0.50 EPS, post-filing headlines confirmed massive miss |
| Transcript | Used | CEO confirmed 200 bps margin headwind through FY23; margin recovery not until Q4 |
| XBRL History | Not queried | 8-K analysis; historical margins from press release |
| Dividends | Checked | $0.27 quarterly dividend declared (35th consecutive) - not a factor |
| Splits | Checked | None |
| Perplexity | Used for consensus validation | Confirmed Q1 FY2023 estimates and timeline |

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Reasoning**:
- Multiple sources agree on the EPS miss magnitude (Benzinga pre-filing vs actual)
- Press release explicitly quantifies margin compression and impairment
- Transcript confirms management's acknowledgment of "couple hundred basis points" margin headwind
- Direction and magnitude of price reaction (-20%) aligns with severity of EPS miss (-90%)
- No conflicting narratives - all sources point to margin/EPS as the driver

**Caveats**:
- Benzinga consensus ($0.50) differs from Perplexity-retrieved estimates ($0.71); used Benzinga as it was time-stamped pre-filing
- GAAP vs Adjusted EPS distinction critical - both showed problems (loss vs 90% miss)

---

## Historical Context (for future analyses)

**Key Learnings for GBX:**

1. **Margins dominate returns for GBX**: Despite revenue beat and strong orders, margin miss drove -20% reaction. For manufacturing companies with thin margins, gross margin % is more important than top-line.

2. **Restructuring announcements amplify negative reaction**: The Portland closure added uncertainty about future cost structure and strategic direction, compounding the margin miss.

3. **Forward visibility matters**: Management's statement that margin recovery wouldn't occur until Q4 FY23 extended the concern timeline, preventing a "transitory" narrative.

4. **Watch manufacturing gross margin**: Q4 FY22 = 10.3%, Q1 FY23 = 6.5%. This 370 bps compression was the root cause.

5. **Supply chain sensitivity**: GBX is highly exposed to outsourced component costs, material shortages, and Mexico rail congestion. These are key risk factors to monitor.
