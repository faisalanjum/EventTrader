- Consensus sources conflicted: Benzinga showed $0.98 EPS est / $785.72M rev est vs Perplexity's $1.17 EPS / $885.61M rev. Used Perplexity as primary.
- FY25 9-month diluted EPS: $5.18 — on track for record FY (prev FY24 record: $4.96)
- Management raised gross margin guidance to 17.7%-18.3% (from 17.0%-17.5%) and operating margin to 10.6%-11.0% (from 10.2%-10.7%)
