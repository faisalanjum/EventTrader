## 1. Executive Summary

**Why did OMC stock drop -5.08% (adjusted)?**

**Root Cause: "Beat-and-Lower" Pattern**

- EPS $1.70 beat $1.64 estimate (+3.7% beat)
- Revenue $3.690B slight miss vs $3.694B estimate
- **Guidance lowered**: Organic growth outlook cut from 3.0%-4.5% to 2.5%-4.5% (50bps lower on bottom end)
- Net income declined 9.7% YoY despite revenue growth
- Key segments underperformed: PR -4.5%, Healthcare -3.2%, Branding/Retail -10%

Despite the EPS beat, the market focused on the guidance reduction driven by macroeconomic uncertainty (tariff overhang from April 2 announcement) and segment-level weakness. Multiple analysts cut price targets the following day, confirming the negative sentiment around forward outlook.

## 6. Point-in-Time Analysis (No Hindsight)

| Time | Event | Market Knowledge |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| April 2, 2025 | Trump tariff announcement | Macro uncertainty elevated |
| April 14, 2025 | Pre-earnings preview | Expectations set at $1.64 EPS, $3.694B revenue |
| April 15, 8:10 AM | Citigroup reinstates Buy, $103 PT | Positive sentiment pre-earnings |
| April 15, 4:03 PM | Earnings released | Beat EPS, miss revenue, guidance lowered |
| April 15, 4:07 PM | 8-K filed | Items 2.02, 7.01, 9.01 |
| April 16-17 | Analyst PT cuts | Wells Fargo -15%, JPM -10%, Barclays -5% |

**Why Stock Moved**: The market reacted to the **guidance cut** more than the EPS beat. When a company beats on earnings but lowers forward expectations, it signals management concern about the path ahead. The 50bps cut to the low end of organic growth guidance, combined with visible weakness in 3 of 5 major segments, triggered multiple analyst downgrades and a 5% adjusted selloff.
