## Analyst Consensus Sources

| Source Type | Reliability for PLCE |
|-------------|---------------------|
| News headlines | HIGH - Provided exact EPS/Revenue estimates |
| Perplexity search | MEDIUM - Corroborated consensus range |
| Transcripts | LOW availability - Only Q4 FY22 in database |

---

## Data Availability Notes

| Data Type | Availability | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| News | GOOD (98 items with returns) | Reliable for consensus extraction |
| Transcripts | POOR (only 1 from 2023) | Missing recent earnings calls |
| XBRL (10-K/10-Q) | GOOD (10 reports) | Full historical financials |
| Dividends | NONE | Company doesn't pay dividends |
| Splits | NONE | No recent splits |

## Special Considerations

1. **Turnaround Story**: PLCE was in multi-year decline; any profitability signal triggers outsized reaction
2. **Small Cap**: ~$128M market cap makes it susceptible to short squeezes
3. **Adjusted Metrics**: Always use Adjusted EPS for consensus comparison; GAAP includes non-cash impairments
4. **Gymboree Brand**: Acquired brand subject to impairment charges (not operational)
