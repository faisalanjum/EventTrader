# Framework v2.0 Improvements Summary

## Key Alignment with Actual AAPL Analysis

### 1. **Confidence Scoring** (Step 8)
**Old**: Mechanical calculation (base 70 + 5 points for various factors)
**New**: Based on explanation quality:
- 95-99%: Multiple corroborating factors with perfect explanation
- 90-94%: 2-3 solid factors
- 85-89%: Primary catalyst clear
- 80-84%: Direction explained but not magnitude
- 75-79%: Weak explanation

**AAPL Reality**: Scores ranged 79-99% based on how well the movement could be explained

### 2. **Reasoning Structure** (Step 10)
**Old**: Simple template with placeholders
**New**: Structured approach:
- Opening statement with key insight
- 3-7 numbered points with specific data
- Always include sector/industry comparison
- Show historical progression where applicable
- Include time dynamics

**AAPL Reality**: Every reason had 4-6 numbered points with exact percentages

### 3. **Driver Specificity** (Step 11)
**Old**: Generic categories like "Revenue miss"
**New**: Specific, memorable drivers:
- Include numbers when impactful ("Sector underperformance -3.86%")
- Use superlatives when accurate ("Weakest iPhone launch ever")
- Show progressions ("4th consecutive disappointment")
- Highlight transitions ("Growth→Value transition")

**AAPL Reality**: Drivers were highly specific and memorable

### 4. **Company Context** (New Step 5)
**Added**: Research company-specific context
- Major revenue segments
- Historical growth patterns
- Seasonal patterns
- Key relationships

**AAPL Reality**: Analysis included knowledge like "iPhone represents 49% of revenue"

### 5. **Historical Pattern Tracking** (Step 4)
**Old**: Just query for past earnings
**New**: Track progression with arrow notation
- Show deterioration: -0.67% → -3.72% → -4.60%
- Include in reasoning

**AAPL Reality**: Historical progression was key to explaining magnitude

### 6. **XBRL Reality Check**
**Old**: Presented as predictive tool
**New**: Clarified as validation tool only
- Arrives too late to explain real-time moves
- Useful for validating analysis
- Optional enhancement

**AAPL Reality**: XBRL provided supporting evidence like "Americas grew only 0.77%"

### 7. **Good vs Bad Example**
**Added**: Side-by-side comparison showing:
- Generic vs specific drivers
- Weak vs strong reasoning
- Low vs high confidence

## Result
The framework now accurately reflects the methodology used to create the high-quality AAPL analysis, ensuring reproducible results for other companies.
