# EventMarketDB Trading System: Implementation Guide

## Rationale: Why This Approach

**The Problem**: We have 2.5 years of EventMarketDB data with 774 stocks showing which events moved prices >2%. Initial analysis of surprise-based trading (actual vs consensus) revealed fundamental barriers:
- Consensus data costs $100k+/year from providers
- Natural language extraction of surprises is complex and error-prone
- Even with perfect data, surprise calculations have low predictive power

**The Pivot**: Instead of calculating surprises, we discovered that:
- We already have driver JSON files showing which events moved stocks
- These files contain patterns extracted from actual price movements
- Adding exception learning (understanding when patterns fail) improves accuracy
- Mechanical filtering can process 10,000 daily events without LLM costs

**The Innovation**: Exception learning - finding similar events that didn't produce expected moves and understanding why. This transforms 56% baseline accuracy into 70%+ achievable accuracy.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**1. Pattern Database**
- Load existing driver JSON files (AAPL_drivers.json, etc.)
- Extract patterns that moved stocks >2%
- Structure: Event headline → Expected move → Confidence
- Include historical frequency and recency

**2. Exception Learning System**
- For each pattern, find similar events with <0.5% move
- Capture context when patterns failed:
  - Market volatility (VIX level)
  - Stock's recent momentum
  - Concurrent market events
  - Time since pattern last worked
- Store as exception rules per pattern

**3. Four-Stage Filtering Pipeline**
- Stage 1: Database query (removes 95% of events)
- Stage 2: Pattern matching (removes 90% of remainder)
- Stage 3: Context validation (removes 80% of remainder)
- Stage 4: Exception checking (removes 50% of remainder)
- Result: 10,000 events → 10 tradeable signals

### Data Flow
```
EventMarketDB → Event Stream → 4-Stage Filter → Pattern Match → Exception Check → Trade Signal
     ↑                                               ↓              ↓
     └─────── Driver JSONs ←────────────────────────┘              ↓
                                                                    ↓
                    Exception Rules ←───────────────────────────────┘
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Data Preparation (3 days)

**Stock Selection Query**:
```cypher
MATCH (c:Company)-[r:INFLUENCES|PRIMARY_FILER]-(event)
WHERE abs(r.hourly_stock - r.hourly_macro) > 2.0
WITH c, 
     count(DISTINCT event) as significant_moves,
     avg(abs(r.volume_traded)) as avg_volume,
     avg(c.mkt_cap) as market_cap
WHERE significant_moves >= 20 
  AND avg_volume > 10000000
  AND market_cap > 1000000000
RETURN c.ticker, c.name, c.sector, significant_moves
ORDER BY avg_volume DESC
```

**Event Cache Creation**:
- Extract all events with adjusted return >1% for selected stocks
- Store headline, datetime, returns (stock/sector/market), volume
- One file per stock for fast access

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (4 days)

**Pattern Clustering** (Mechanical):
- Use sentence embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Group events with >85% similarity
- Select highest magnitude event from each cluster
- Result: 15-30 patterns per stock (not hundreds)

**Pattern JSON Generation** (LLM - One-time):
- Input: Event + historical context + sector performance
- Output: Structured reasoning + key drivers + confidence
- Cost: ~$0.50 per stock for 150 stocks = $75

### Phase 3: Exception Learning (3 days)

**Finding Exceptions** (Mechanical):
```python
for pattern in top_patterns:
    similar_events = find_similar(pattern.headline, similarity > 0.85)
    exceptions = [e for e in similar_events if abs(e.return) < 0.5]
    
    for exception in exceptions:
        context = {
            'vix': get_vix(exception.date),
            'stock_momentum': calculate_5day_return(exception.date),
            'days_since_pattern': days_since_last_use(pattern),
            'concurrent_events': get_market_events(exception.date)
        }
```

**Exception Analysis** (LLM - Minimal):
- Input: Pattern + exception cases + context
- Output: Simple rule like "Fails when VIX > 30"
- Cost: ~$0.05 per pattern × 5 patterns × 150 stocks = $37.50

### Phase 4: Real-Time System (1 week)

**Filter Pipeline Implementation**:

```python
# Stage 1: Database Filter
events = query_recent_events(
    tickers=monitored_stocks,
    keywords=['earnings', 'guidance', 'SEC', 'FDA'],
    time_window='10 minutes'
)

# Stage 2: Pattern Matching
for event in events:
    if regex_match(event, pattern_db):
        candidate = event
    elif semantic_similarity(event, pattern_db) > 0.85:
        candidate = event
    
# Stage 3: Context Validation
if pattern_fresh(pattern, days=7) and \
   market_session_valid(event) and \
   market_conditions_normal():
    validated = candidate

# Stage 4: Exception Checking
if not any_exception_triggered(pattern, current_context):
    signal = validated
```

**Signal Generation**:
- Expected move = pattern's historical average
- Confidence = base confidence × (1 - exception probability)
- Position size = base size × confidence factor
- Stop loss = 50% of expected move
- Time limit = 24 hours maximum

## Why This Works

**1. Leverages Existing Assets**
- Driver JSONs already contain analyzed patterns
- No need to discover patterns from scratch
- Built on 2.5 years of validated data

**2. Mechanical Execution**
- 99% of filtering is rule-based
- No subjective interpretation
- No emotional decision-making
- LLM only for initial setup (~$100)

**3. Learning from Failures**
- Traditional systems only learn from successes
- We explicitly learn when patterns don't work
- Exception rules prevent repeat failures

**4. Realistic Scope**
- Not trying to predict all movements
- Focus on patterns we understand
- Start with 50-200 liquid stocks
- 2-5 trades per day is sufficient

## Operational Workflow

### Daily Pre-Market
1. Load pattern database with any updates
2. Check market conditions (VIX, futures)
3. Review previous day's exception triggers
4. Verify all systems operational

### Intraday Execution
1. Query for new events every 30 seconds
2. Run through 4-stage filter
3. Generate signals with position sizing
4. Execute trades (paper or real)
5. Monitor existing positions
6. Exit at targets or time limits

### Post-Market Review
1. Log all trades with outcomes
2. Identify any new exceptions
3. Update pattern performance metrics
4. Note unusual market conditions

## Success Metrics

**System Health**:
- Events processed per minute
- Filter rejection rates by stage
- Pattern match accuracy
- Exception trigger frequency

**Trading Performance**:
- Win rate (target >65%)
- Average win vs loss ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Sharpe ratio

**Pattern Decay**:
- Pattern performance over time
- Exception rule accuracy
- Need for pattern refresh

## Scaling Strategy

**Week 1-2**: Paper trade with 50 most liquid stocks
**Week 3-4**: If win rate >65%, continue paper trading
**Month 2**: Add next 75 stocks if system stable
**Month 3**: Small real money positions if consistent
**Month 6**: Full implementation if profitable

## Technical Requirements

**Infrastructure**:
- EventMarketDB with Neo4j access
- Redis for queue management
- Python environment with ML libraries
- Real-time data feed access

**Key Libraries**:
- sentence-transformers (pattern matching)
- pandas/numpy (data processing)
- neo4j-driver (database queries)
- asyncio (real-time processing)

## Cost Analysis

**One-Time Setup**:
- Pattern analysis: ~$75
- Exception analysis: ~$37.50
- Total LLM cost: ~$100-120

**Ongoing Operations**:
- No LLM costs for daily operations
- All filtering is mechanical
- Optional monthly pattern refresh: ~$20

## Risk Management

**System Risks**:
- Pattern decay over time
- Market regime changes
- Overuse of patterns
- Technical failures

**Mitigation**:
- Monthly pattern performance review
- Exception rules for market conditions
- Pattern freshness requirements
- Redundant system components

## Conclusion

This system succeeds through:
1. **Mechanical filtering** that removes noise without ongoing costs
2. **Exception learning** that prevents predictable failures  
3. **Leveraging existing patterns** from 2.5 years of analysis
4. **Realistic scope** focusing on achievable goals

The implementation requires ~3 weeks and ~$100 in LLM costs to build a system that can process 10,000 daily events into 2-5 high-quality trading signals with >65% expected accuracy.
