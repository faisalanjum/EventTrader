Fiscal 2Q25 Results April 23, 2025 Forward-looking statements Certain statements made in this presentation and the associated conference call may constitute “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated savings, financial results (including expenses, earnings, liquidity, cash flow and capital expenditures), industry or market conditions (including changes in interest rates and inflation), demand for and pricing of our products (including cash sweep and deposit offerings), anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions or divestitures, and our level of success in integrating acquired businesses, anticipated results of litigation, regulatory developments, and general economic conditions. In addition, words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” and future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” and “would,” as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward- looking statements. We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) from time to time, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are available at www.raymondjames.com and the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 2 Strategic Overview Paul Shoukry Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial 3 4 2Q25 highlights Earnings Key Performance Metrics Capital & Liquidity $3.4B Net revenues $1.54T Client assets under administration $250M Common share repurchases 19.7% Pre-tax margin 20.3% Adjusted pre-tax margin(1) $873B PCG assets in fee-based accounts $190M Common share repurchases in April 2025 $8.8B | 2.6% growth rate Domestic PCG net new assets(2)$2.36 Diluted EPS $2.42 Adjusted diluted EPS(1) $104M Common stock dividends $57.8B Clients' domestic cash sweep and ESP balances 16.4% Return on common equity 19.7% Adjusted ROTCE(1) 13.3% Tier 1 leverage ratio(3) $48.3B Bank loans, net $2.5B RJF corporate cash(4) Note: Three months ended March 31, 2025, unless otherwise noted.

These non- GAAP financial measures have been separately identified in this document. We believe certain of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors by excluding certain material items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We utilize these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the financial performance of the business, as they facilitate a comparison of current- and prior-period results. We believe that return on tangible common equity and tangible book value per share are meaningful to investors as they facilitate comparisons of our results to the results of other companies. In the following tables, the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments reflects the statutory rate associated with each non-GAAP item. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for those periods which include non-GAAP adjustments.

Footnotes 26 (1) Includes acquisition-related compensation expenses primarily arising from equity and cash-based retention awards issued in conjunction with acquisitions in prior years. Such retention awards are generally contingent upon the post-closing continuation of service of certain associates who joined the firm as part of such acquisitions and are expensed over the requisite service period.
