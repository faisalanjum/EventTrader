PETERSBURG, Fla. – Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE: RJF) today reported net revenues of $3.40 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $493 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2025. Excluding $19 million of expenses related to acquisitions, quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $507 million(1), or $2.42 per diluted share(1). “I am pleased with our record results for the first six months of fiscal 2025, with record net revenues of $6.94 billion and record pre-tax income of $1.42 billion, up 13% and 15% over the first six months of fiscal 2024, respectively,” said CEO Paul Shoukry. “Financial advisor recruiting activity remains strong across all of our affiliation options, reflecting the attractiveness of our unique advisor- and client-focused culture coupled with leading capabilities enabling advisors to provide high-quality financial advice to their clients. The investment banking pipeline remains robust, although the timing of closings has been impacted by the macroeconomic uncertainty associated with tariff negotiations. Our strong balance sheet, with capital well above regulatory requirements and corporate cash well in excess of our targets, should help us navigate this period from a position of strength.” Compared to the prior-year quarter, quarterly net revenues increased 9% and pre-tax income increased 10% primarily driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income decreased 4% and 10%, respectively, predominantly driven by lower investment banking revenues. The sequential decrease in net income available to common shareholders was also impacted by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter. For the fiscal second quarter, annualized return on common equity and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity were 16.4% and 19.7%(1), respectively. Please refer to the footnotes at the end of this press release for additional information. 1 For the first six months of the fiscal year, record net revenues of $6.94 billion increased 13%, record earnings per diluted share of $5.22 increased 15%, and record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.36(1) increased 14% over the first six months of fiscal 2024. The Private Client Group and Asset Management segments generated record net revenues and pre-tax income during the first six months of fiscal 2025. Annualized return on common equity was 18.4% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22.1%(1). Segment Results Private Client Group •Quarterly net revenues of $2.49 billion, up 6% over the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and down 2% compared to the preceding quarter •Quarterly pre-tax income of $431 million, down 3% compared to the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and 7% compared to the preceding quarter •Private Client Group assets under administration of $1.48 trillion, up 6% over March 2024 and down 1% compared to December 2024 •Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts of $872.8 billion, up 9% over March 2024 and nearly flat from December 2024 •Domestic Private Client Group net new assets(2) of $8.8 billion for the fiscal second quarter, or annualized growth from beginning of period assets of 2.6%; Fiscal year-to-date, domestic Private Client Group net new assets of $22.9 billion or 3.3% annualized •Total clients’ domestic cash sweep and ESP balances of $57.8 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and 3% compared to the preceding quarter PCG quarterly net revenues grew 6% year-over-year primarily driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees which were partially offset by the impacts of lower short-term interest rates. Over the same period, PCG assets in fee-based accounts grew 9% driven by market appreciation and net asset inflows. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues declined 2% mainly due to lower asset management and related administrative fees resulting from fewer billable days in the quarter. Capital Markets •Quarterly net revenues of $396 million, up 23% over the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and down 18% compared to the preceding quarter •Quarterly investment banking revenues of $207 million, up 21% over the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and down 35% compared to the preceding quarter •Quarterly pre-tax income of $36 million Year-over-year, quarterly net revenues increased 23%, driven mainly by higher investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenues. Sequentially, net revenues decreased 18% due to lower investment banking revenues, despite higher fixed income brokerage revenues. The macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened volatility resulted in unfavorable market conditions during the quarter which led to decreased investment banking activity; however, the investment banking pipeline remains strong. Asset Management •Quarterly net revenues of $289 million, up 15% over the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and down 2% compared to the preceding quarter •Quarterly pre-tax income of $121 million, up 21% over the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and down 3% compared to the preceding quarter •Financial assets under management of $245.0 billion, up 8% over March 2024 and slightly above the December 2024 levels The increase in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income over the prior year’s fiscal second quarter is largely attributable to higher financial assets under management due to higher market appreciation and net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group. Please refer to the footnotes at the end of this press release for additional information. 2 Bank •Quarterly net revenues of $434 million, up 2% over both the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and the preceding quarter •Quarterly pre-tax income of $117 million, up 56% over the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and down 1% compared to the preceding quarter •Record net loans of $48.3 billion, up 9% over March 2024 and 2% over December 2024 •Bank segment net interest margin (“NIM”) of 2.67% for the quarter, up 1 basis point over the prior year’s fiscal second quarter and 7 basis points over the preceding quarter Net loans grew 2% over the preceding quarter, mainly driven by continued growth of securities-based loans. Bank segment NIM expanded by 7 basis points to 2.67%, largely a result of a favorable asset mix shift, along with a higher portion of lower cost deposits, which contributed to sequential quarterly net revenue growth of 2%. The loan portfolio continues to maintain strong credit quality and healthy reserves. Other The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%, reflecting nondeductible losses on the company-owned life insurance portfolio. During the fiscal second quarter, the firm repurchased common stock of $250 million at an average price of $146 per share. Subsequent to quarter-end, the firm repurchased additional shares of common stock for $190 million at an average price of $125 per share. As of April 21, 2025, approximately $1.01 billion remained available under the Board’s approved common stock repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, the total capital ratio was 24.8%(3) and the tier 1 leverage ratio was 13.3%(3), both well above regulatory requirements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Fiscal Second Quarter of 2025 (Unaudited) Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures as additional measures to aid in, and enhance, the understanding of our financial results and related measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have been separately identified in this document. We believe certain of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors by excluding certain material items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We utilize these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the financial performance of the business, as they facilitate a comparison of current- and prior-period results. We believe that return on tangible common equity and tangible book value per share are meaningful to investors as they facilitate comparisons of our results to the results of other companies. In the following tables, the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments reflects the statutory rate associated with each non-GAAP item. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Fiscal Second Quarter of 2025 Footnotes (1) These are non-GAAP financial measures. See the schedules on the previous pages for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and for more information on these measures. (2) Domestic Private Client Group net new assets represents domestic Private Client Group client inflows, including dividends and interest, less domestic Private Client Group client outflows, including commissions, advisory fees, and other fees. The domestic Private Client Group net new asset growth — annualized percentage is based on the beginning domestic Private Client Group assets under administration balance for the indicated period. (3) Estimated. (4) Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders (less allocation of earnings and dividends to participating securities) by weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic or diluted as applicable) for each respective period or, in the case of adjusted earnings per common share, computed by dividing adjusted net income available to common shareholders (less allocation of earnings and dividends to participating securities) by weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic or diluted as applicable) for each respective period. The allocations of earnings and dividends to participating securities were $1 million for each of the three months ended March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2024, and $2 million for both of the six months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. (5) Return on common equity is computed by dividing annualized net income available to common shareholders by average common equity for each respective period or, in the case of return on tangible common equity, computed by dividing annualized net income available to common shareholders by average tangible common equity for each respective period. Adjusted return on common equity is computed by dividing annualized adjusted net income available to common shareholders by adjusted average common equity for each respective period, or in the case of adjusted return on tangible common equity, computed by dividing annualized adjusted net income available to common shareholders by adjusted average tangible common equity for each respective period. Tangible common equity is defined as total common equity attributable to Raymond James Financial, Inc. less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, net of related deferred taxes. (6) Pre-tax margin is computed by dividing pre-tax income by net revenues for each respective period or, in the case of adjusted pre-tax margin, computed by dividing adjusted pre-tax income by net revenues for each respective period. (7) Total compensation ratio is computed by dividing compensation, commissions and benefits expense by net revenues for each respective period or, in the case of adjusted total compensation ratio, computed by dividing adjusted compensation, commissions and benefits expense by net revenues for each respective period. (8) Book value per share is computed by dividing total common equity attributable to Raymond James Financial, Inc. by the number of common shares outstanding at the end of each respective period or, in the case of tangible book value per share, computed by dividing tangible common equity by the number of common shares outstanding at the end of each respective period. (9) We earn fees from the RJBDP, a multi-bank sweep program in which clients’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are swept into interest-bearing deposit accounts at our Bank segment, as well as various third-party banks. RJBDP balances swept to our Bank segment are reflected in Bank deposits on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition and within money market and other savings accounts in our net interest disclosures in this release. RJBDP balances swept to third-party banks are not included in our Bank deposits on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition given those deposits are held by third-party banks. Fees earned from the RJBDP are included in “Account and service fees” on our Consolidated Statements of Income, and those fees earned by the Private Client Group segment on deposits held by our Bank segment are eliminated in consolidation. (10) Our Enhanced Savings Program is a deposit offering in which Private Client Group clients may deposit cash in a high-yield Raymond James Bank account. ESP balances held at Raymond James Bank as of the respective period end are reflected in Bank deposits on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition and the vast majority are included within interest-bearing demand deposits in our net interest disclosures in this release. (11) Average yield on RJBDP - third-party banks is computed by dividing annualized RJBDP fees - third-party banks, which are net of the interest expense paid to clients by the third-party banks, by the average daily RJBDP balances at third-party banks. (12) Loans are presented net of unamortized purchase discounts or premiums, unearned income, deferred origination fees and costs, and charge-offs. (13) Securities-based loans included loans collateralized by the borrower’s marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards and, to a lesser extent, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies. An insignificant portion of our securities-based loans portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market. (14) The average rate on tax-exempt loans is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis utilizing the applicable federal statutory rates for each respective period. (15) The average balance, interest expense, and average rate for “Total bank deposits” included amounts associated with affiliate deposits. Such amounts are eliminated in consolidation and are offset in “All other interest-bearing liabilities” under “All other segments.” (16) The Other segment includes interest income on certain corporate cash balances, the results of our private equity investments, which predominantly consist of investments in third-party funds, certain other corporate investing activity, and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF that are not allocated to other segments including the interest costs on our public debt, certain provisions for legal and regulatory matters, and certain acquisition-related expenses. (17) Effective October 1, 2024, we updated our methodology for allocating interest income on certain cash balances, resulting in a reduction in interest income in the Other segment and an increase in interest income in the PCG segment. Prior-period segment results have not been conformed to the current-period presentation. (18) Corporate loans included commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and real estate investment trust loans. 23 RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. Fiscal Second Quarter of 2025 Footnotes (19) Includes acquisition-related compensation expenses primarily arising from equity and cash-based retention awards issued in conjunction with acquisitions in prior years. Such retention awards are generally contingent upon the post-closing continuation of service of certain associates who joined the firm as part of such acquisitions and are expensed over the requisite service period.
