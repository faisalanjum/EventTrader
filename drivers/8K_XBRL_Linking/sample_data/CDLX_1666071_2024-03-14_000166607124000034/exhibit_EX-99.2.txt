$73.0 Plus: Consumer Incentives $35.0 - $36.0 Billings $105.0 - $109.0 Definitions Adjusted Contribution: We define Adjusted Contribution measures of the degree by which revenue generated from our marketers exceeds the cost to obtain the purchase data and the digital advertising space from our partners. Adjusted Contribution demonstrates how incremental marketing on our platform generates incremental amounts to support our sales and marketing, research and development, delivery costs, general and administration and other investments. Adjusted Contribution is calculated by taking our total revenue less our Partner Share and other third-party costs. Adjusted Contribution does not take into account all costs associated with generating revenue from advertising campaigns, including sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, delivery costs, general and administrative expenses and other expenses, which we do not take into consideration when making decisions on how to manage our advertising campaigns. Adjusted EBITDA: We define Adjusted EBITDA as our Net loss before interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation expense; acquisition, integration and divestiture costs (benefit); change in fair value of contingent consideration; foreign currency (gain) loss; impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; deferred implementation costs; and income tax benefit Cardlytics ARPU: We define ARPU as the total Cardlytics platform Revenue generated in the applicable period calculated in accordance with GAAP, divided by the average number of MAUs in the applicable period. Billings: Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers and marketers for advertising campaigns in order to generate revenue. Cardlytics platform Billings is recognized gross of both Consumer Incentives and Partner Share. Cardlytics platform GAAP Revenue is recognized net of Consumer Incentives and gross of Partner Share. Bridg platform Billings is the same as Bridg platform GAAP Revenue. Free Cash Flow: We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, plus acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of patents and capitalized software development costs. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available to invest in the business. We believe this supplemental information enhances stockholders' ability to evaluate our performance. Cardlytics MAUs: We define MAUs as targetable customers that have logged in and visited online or mobile applications containing offers, opened an email containing an offer, or redeemed an offer from the Cardlytics platform during a monthly period. We then calculate a monthly average of these MAUs for the periods presented. We believe that MAUs is an indicator of the Cardlytics platform's ability to drive engagement and is reflective of the marketing base that we offer to marketers. As of September 30, 2023, we are reporting only the total number of unique targetable customers within each FI, which we have applied to our reporting for current and prior periods. Adjusted Net Income (Loss): We define Adjusted Income (Loss) as our Net Loss before stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; acquisition, integration and divestiture cost (benefit); amortization of acquired intangibles; change in fair value of contingent considerations; impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; and income tax benefit. Notably, any impacts related to minimum Partner Share commitments in connection with agreements with certain Partners are not added back to net loss in order to calculate adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per share: We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per share as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by GAAP weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted.
