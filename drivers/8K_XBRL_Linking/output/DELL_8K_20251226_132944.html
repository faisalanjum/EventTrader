Additionally, Corporate and other includes other items that are managed at the corporate level and are not allocated to reportable segments. (b)Depreciation expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in the operating results of each segment.

(d)Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date.
