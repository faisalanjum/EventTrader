However, these plans are still tentative, according to officials privy to the matter, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/22/marco-rubio-panama-00200137\">reported</a> Politico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This visit, which could reportedly take place as early as next week, follows President <strong>Donald Trump&#8217;s</strong> controversial remarks hinting at the U.S. potentially reclaiming the Panama Canal. These comments have sparked a diplomatic spat with Panama. &#8220;The Panama Canal belongs to Panama and will continue to belong to Panama,&#8221; asserted Panama&#8217;s President, <strong>José Raúl Mulino</strong>, at the World Economic Forum earlier this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his tour, Rubio is expected to tackle two critical issues on the MAGA foreign policy agenda: illegal migration and the Panama Canal. The countries on Rubio&#8217;s travel list,&nbsp;including Guatemala and El Salvador,&nbsp;are key transit points for migrants heading to the U.S. southern border.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent memo&nbsp;to State Department employees, Rubio&nbsp;underscored mass migration as &#8220;among&nbsp;the most consequential issues of&nbsp;our time&#8221; and committed to collaborating with Western Hemisphere nations to stem illegal immigration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The State Department has not yet commented on Rubio&#8217;s impending travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The controversy over the Panama Canal has been brewing for some time.

This usually means there is a topping formation in progress. That said, financials continue to move constructively northward and the heels of earnings for American Express (AXP) take place on Friday morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today we're looking at a bullish trade on AXP's earnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today's trade will be a long call butterfly spread. <strong>When we position with long call butterfly spreads, we attempt to collect a premium that is generated by a strong move in the underlying stock's chart. We offset the cost of the long calls into earnings with a short call spread that mitigates some of the risk premium incurred taking the position</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trade structure – the long call butterfly with a twist</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The long call butterfly consists of two spreads – a long call spread and a short call spread that attempts to capture the potential upward spike in price from the earnings release. To help pay for this position we will sell a short call spread to collect a premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AXP's stock price is currently range bound with resistance near $340 and support near $300. With that in mind, here's the trade:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy to open</strong> 1 AXP 21 Feb 330 calls</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sell to open</strong> 1 AXP 21 Feb 340 calls</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy to open</strong> 1 AXP 21 Feb 345 calls</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At this writing the debit cost is $1.90 and the maximum profit will be the distance between the first two strikes (330 and 340), which is $10, less the cost of $1.90 = $8.10 or $810. Notice, however, that the short call spread is only $5 wide, so if the price action shoots past $345, we would still have $5 from the first spread, less the cost – and this would still deliver over 150% gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our maximum risk is simply the cost of the spread – if the price action fades, or does not rise past $330, we will lose the cost of the debit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trade Management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The strategy result provides three ways to exit the trade:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sell the butterfly once it gets to an acceptable profit margin for you. I customarily look for 150%-300% profit for these kinds of trades in the current environment of volatility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sell the butterfly once it hits a loss threshold as determined by personal risk – this will happen with extreme movement. I customarily look at about 70% though depending on my size.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ssell the butterfly into the week before expiration, if all is going well and you have decided to hold the trade into closer to the end of expiration (I have had many a trade go sideways taking it down to the wire and not capturing gains, so I do not advise this).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Every morning our experts zero in on ONE stock flashing clear technical signals. Then hand you a power-packed chart setup with high profit potential – confusion free. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/premium/ideas/benzinga-edge/?utm_source=WebRD-0123&amp;el=ResearchDaily&amp;he={{email}}&amp;adt_ei={{email}}\"><strong>Come Join Us Every Morning Here</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image via Shutterstock</p>","authors":["Anne-Marie Baiynd"],"teaser":"Bullish trade on AXP&#39;s earnings with a long call butterfly spread.

The U.S. Mint produced 4.5 billion pennies last year, representing approximately 40% of total coin circulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current production costs render each penny economically inefficient. The coin&#8217;s composition — 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper plating — costs more to create than its one-cent value.

Economic experts have long argued that maintaining low-denomination coins creates unnecessary financial burden. Several allied nations, including Canada and the United Kingdom, have already eliminated similar low-value coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The penny&#8217;s production involves a complex six-step process across four U.S. Mint facilities, with parts and labor accounting for 88% of manufacturing costs.

Raw Data: {"api_version":"websocket/v1","kind":"News/v1","data":{"action":"Created","id":96942057,"content":{"id":43165973,"revision_id":51465484,"type":"story","title":"&#39;The DEA Ruling Was A Game-Changer&#39;: Why This European Cannabis Giant Is Betting On The American Seeds Market","body":"<p>\"Ever since the DEA clarified that cannabis seeds are federally legal, we knew it was time to come to the U.S.,\" says <strong>Nick Avé,</strong> general manager at <strong>Zamnesia,</strong> during an exclusive interview at <strong>MJBizCon</strong> in Las Vegas. For the pioneering European smart shop, this decision marked a significant milestone in its evolution from a European online store into a powerhouse of natural wellness products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DEA's clarification on cannabis seeds provided a pivotal turning point for companies like Zamnesia. Previously, cannabis seeds existed in a legal grey area, overshadowed by other facets of the industry. The ruling confirmed that seeds with less than 0.3% THC are classified as hemp, allowing for their sale and distribution across the U.S., regardless of whether they originate from hemp or marijuana plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This development comes at an ideal time. In 2022, the U.S. cannabis seed market was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierhasse/2025/01/20/how-european-cannabis-seed-companies-are-quietly-taking-over-the-us-market/\">valued</a> at $567.76 million and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.2%, reaching $2.02 billion by 2030, according to <strong>Data Bridge Market Research.</strong> Similarly, <strong>New Frontier Data</strong> estimates that the home-grow market could nearly quadruple to $4 billion by the end of the decade. This growing sector is fueled by increased legalization, with many states supporting home cultivation as part of their recreational and medical cannabis frameworks. In 2022, an estimated 6% of U.S. cannabis consumers grew their own flower, producing 11 million pounds of dried cannabis—a figure expected to rise to 15 million pounds by 2030.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing these trends, Zamnesia has focused its U.S. strategy on home-growing and cannabis seeds, products already central to its European operations—a tendency seen across the industry, as <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierhasse/2025/01/20/how-european-cannabis-seed-companies-are-quietly-taking-over-the-us-market/\">European seed companies quietly take over the American market</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> \"The U.S. market is just as big, if not bigger, than Europe,\" says Avé. With operations headquartered in North Carolina, the company is distributing seeds across most states while avoiding those with less favorable regulatory environments. \"We're selling nationally, except for a couple of states where the laws are less clear.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How THE DEA CHANGED The CANNABIS GAME (FOR GOOD &#x1f92f;)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwrvHU00FXk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Inside A Smart Shop Revolution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For Avé, Zamnesia's U.S. expansion represents the latest chapter in a personal journey intertwined with the company's growth. He joined Zamnesia 12 years ago, starting in customer service at a time when the company was still a modest operation. \"I started in customer service, and after two years, I was asked to take on more responsibilities. Back then, we were a super small company.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Zamnesia is a leader in Europe's burgeoning cannabis, psychedelic and functional mushroom markets. Often described as a \"smart shop,\" the company blends elements of head shops and smoke shops, offering a diverse catalog that includes cannabis seeds, functional mushrooms and educational resources. \"We have a broader catalog than just a regular head shop or smoke shop,\" says Avé. \"We also do a lot of education, which sets us apart.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company's decision to remain an online-first retailer, rather than operate brick-and-mortar stores, has been central to its success. \"Physical stores, especially in Amsterdam, come with a lot of overhead and increasing regulations,\" explains Avé. \"We've always preferred online—it's faster, more scalable and allows us to reach customers across Europe.\" By focusing on e-commerce, Zamnesia has been able to serve a wide variety of markets, tailoring its product offerings to comply with the diverse regulations of each country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We open up specific product categories for different countries and keep a close eye on laws because they change a lot,\" says Avé. Germany's decision to loosen restrictions on cannabis in 2023, for example, has opened new doors for Zamnesia to expand its reach. This adaptability has been key to the company's growth and is a cornerstone of its strategy as it enters the U.S. market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bridging The Gap Between Europe And The U.S.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Zamnesia's success in Europe was built on its ability to navigate a complex legal and logistical landscape. While Europe may be geographically small, its fragmented regulatory environment presents challenges for businesses looking to scale. \"We've seen Germany open up, but the laws across Europe vary greatly. It's all about understanding where we can operate and what we can offer,\" says Avé.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, the company attempted to sell products outside Europe but quickly encountered insurmountable logistical hurdles. Today, Zamnesia takes a market-by-market approach, tailoring its operations to meet local regulations. This approach has been especially critical for its psychedelic product offerings, which remain largely unavailable in the U.S. market. \"The biggest difference between Europe and the U.S. is the type of products we can sell,\" Avé explains. \"In Europe, we can sell psychedelic products and functional mushrooms, whereas in the U.S., we're more limited to seeds and hemp-derived products.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these limitations, the U.S. presents an unparalleled opportunity. With its established reputation for quality cannabis genetics, Zamnesia is well-positioned to serve the booming home-grow market. \"A state like Ohio, for example, blew my mind,\" says Avé. \"It's one of the best markets for home growing, which I never would have guessed.\" This discovery reflects a broader trend in the U.S., where home cultivation is gaining traction as consumers seek to connect more deeply with the plant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusive data provided by <strong>Fast Buds,</strong> another European cannabis seed company operating in the U.S., with over 1 million unique monthly visitors to its website, further supports this trend. According to its internal consumer data, Ohio is indeed the state for cannabis seed purchases in the U.S., followed by Minnesota, Illinois, Virginia and New York. These states represent a diverse mix of emerging and established cannabis markets, highlighting the growing demand for home-growing solutions across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zamnesia's expansion isn't just about selling seeds, it's about bringing the company's ethos of education and community to a new audience. \"Home-growing isn't just about saving money; it's about connecting with the plant,\" Avé says. By leveraging its expertise, Zamnesia aims to empower American growers, both novice and experienced, with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Overcoming Logistical And Linguistic Barriers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Zamnesia's most impressive feats has been its ability to manage a multilingual, multinational operation. The company's website operates in six languages—English, Spanish, Dutch, German, French and Italian—making it accessible to a wide range of customers. However, building this infrastructure was no small task. \"In the beginning, it was tough. We didn't even have professional translators. We'd ask customers to translate for us, and the results weren't great.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Zamnesia uses a sophisticated system that connects freelance writers and translators to ensure high-quality content. However, Avé acknowledges that translation alone isn't enough. \"We're working on writing native content in Spanish, for example, because translated text often misses the nuance and appeal of original writing.\" This commitment to authenticity and cultural relevance will be critical as Zamnesia navigates the U.S. market's linguistic and cultural diversity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, Avé envisions further expansion into Latin America and other emerging markets. However, he is candid about the challenges. \"Shipping seeds from the U.S. to Mexico, for example, would be logistically problematic. We'd need a local presence.\" For now, the company is focused on conquering the U.S. market, a task Avé describes as both ambitious and essential. \"There's a lot of competition, and we've got our hands full.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By drawing on its European expertise, embracing a customer-first philosophy and investing in scalable solutions, Zamnesia is poised to make a lasting impact on the U.S. cannabis market. With an unwavering focus on quality, education and innovation, the company's journey is just beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierhasse/2024/06/26/whoopi-goldberg-talks-cannabis-medicine-doesnt-have-to-be-horrifying-or-unreasonably-priced/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Forbes</a> and appears here with permission.

In December, Xi announced in a keynote speech the Chinese economy is <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-long-xi-trying-boost-chinas-economy-stimulus-not-reforms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">both stable and making progress</a>, while economic, social, and development goals and tasks were on course for success. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Xi also stated that the Chinese government's policy in 2025 will be focused on boosting consumption with the help of a moderately loose monetary policy and a more active fiscal policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Xi has suggested that the Chinese economy will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/31/xi-china-economy-trump-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">grow by 5% in 2025</a> despite fears over the prospect of US President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs hurting the nation's exports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reception to Xi's positive outlook has been mixed, with <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-eases-monetary-policy-stance-073152230.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Morgan Stanley noting</a> that the stance reflects China's ‘most aggressive stimulus tone in a decade' while also acknowledging that its implementation will be crucial. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a clear plan, China's markets remain in a state of flux. While Chinese stocks have traded higher in the wake of the government's stimulus package announcement, they've failed to generate any momentum for further growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rhodium Group estimates suggest that China's GDP growth in 2024 <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/after-the-fall-chinas-economy-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fell well below its targets</a>, improving between 2.4% and 2.8%. However, the think tank believes that China could still post growth of between 3% to 4.5% over the year ahead depending on its stimulus strategy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, should investors look to China's discounted stocks ahead of an expected recovery? The answer lies in balancing optimism and harsh realities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Arrival of Stimulus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The October announcement that China would shift towards a series of supportive policy measures to support its ailing economy brought a flurry of optimism to domestic markets. As a result, Chinese stocks recorded their <a href=\"https://www.juliusbaer.com/en/insights/market-insights/market-outlook/chinas-stimulus-package-short-term-relief-or-long-term-recovery/#:~:text=long%2Dterm%20recovery%3F-,China's%20stimulus%20package%3A%20Short%2Dterm,relief%20or%20long%2Dterm%20recovery%3F&amp;text=The%20shift%20towards%20more%20supportive,Chinese%20stocks%20in%2016%20years.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">largest jump in 16 years</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, since its October 8, 2024, peak, the CSI 300 Index (SHA: 000300) ended the year 7.55% down on its previous high in the wake of the announcement, suggesting that enthusiasm for the stimulus package is waning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What form has China's stimulus strategy taken? Focusing on lowering the cost of borrowing, the People's Bank of China (PBC) cut interest rates on existing mortgages by 0.5 percentage points and lowered the level of reserves banks must set aside before making loans in a bid to increase new lending.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to PBC governor, Pan Gonsheng, restrictions of borrowing for investments in stocks and shares on Chinese exchanges would see fewer restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The measures saw both the Shanghai Composite Index initially embark on a rally while Brent crude oil prices also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/24/china-economy-stimulus-package-measures-yuan-pbc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increased more than 1%</a> at the prospect of fresh productivity from the industrial powerhouse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the months that followed have seen optimism over the success of the measures weaken amid fears that the strategy isn't strong enough to deliver sufficient growth, particularly amid the return of the famously China-sceptical Trump.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will China Recover in 2025?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following Trump's re-election in November 2024, there were fresh fears that China wouldn't simply need to focus on domestic growth, but its government would have to protect against the threat of severe declines in exports to the US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Goldman Sachs research, the impact of tariffs will be significant for China. At present, we don't know what the extent of Trump's tariffs will look like, but with the President-elect's promise to place an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/26/trump-vows-an-additional-10percent-tariff-on-china-25percent-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">additional 10% tariff</a> on Chinese imports, it's clear that 2025 will see fresh hurdles impact growth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Goldman Sachs estimates suggest that stimulus could partially offset the impact of tariffs in 2025, the Chinese economy is likely to <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/chinas-economic-stimulus-to-partially-offset-us-tariffs-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decelerate to 4.5%</a> from 4.9% in 2024 in a forecast that echoes Rhodium Group's projections for the year ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The figures forecasted by Goldman Sachs anticipate a 20 percentage-point increase in the effective tariff rate imposed by Trump, so investors must monitor the early movements put into place by the incoming administration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worryingly, National Bureau of Statistics data has claimed that factory activity growth has failed to generate any meaningful momentum for China in the months following its stimulus announcement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the nation's official purchasing managers' index, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/31/chinas-factory-activity-growth-misses-expectations-as-experts-decry-insufficient-stimulus-measures.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">December's rate of 50.1</a> missed Reuters' expectations of 50.3 for the month. The data also shows that manufacturing activity had fallen from November's 50.3 and aligned with October's 50.1. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the available data for the final month of December suggests that to meet its GDP targets, China's stimulus strategy must become more aggressively growth-focused to fully avoid the impact of Trump's tariffs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Could Investors Pick Up Discounted Stocks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There's certainly a high level of risk associated with Chinese stocks today, but for institutional investors that believe in China's growth potential should its stimulus measure pick up, there may be some low-cost opportunities with improved prospects in a strengthening economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, China Beige Book Analysts have suggested that foreign observers appear <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/china-economy-beige-book-stimulus-d5eefa25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more convinced</a> about the upside of China's pledged fiscal spending than domestic firms are. This misalignment of optimism could point to the value of taking more caution and <a href=\"https://www.26degreesglobalmarkets.com/broker-dealers/risk-solutions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">optimizing risk management</a> solutions before buying into Chinese stocks in Q1 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it appears that most wise institutions would benefit from looking more to the US than to China for the tariff implications on Chinese trade. In the geopolitical landscape of 2025, it's likely to be the Trump administration that has a major say in China's long road to recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>On the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This increased settlement, announced Thursday, follows the U.S. Supreme Court's <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/large-cap/24/06/39531087/purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-plan-rejected-by-supreme-court-billionaire-sacklers-to-face-lawsuits\">June 2024 rejection</a> of a prior deal and, if approved, will conclude the most expensive corporate bankruptcy tied to the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/opioid-crisis\">opioid epidemic</a>, which has claimed at least <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">106,000 lives</a> in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Purdue Pharma developed and aggressively marketed OxyContin starting in the 1990s via medical sales reps&nbsp;whose job was to convince doctors to prescribe more of their drug. Inappropriate prescribing of opioids was given as one of the major causes of U.S. overdoses, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/statistics/index.html\">according</a> to the office of Dept. of&nbsp;Health and Human Services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"This story is about a family of cruel billionaires who believed they were above the law,\" said Connecticut Attorney General <strong>William Tong</strong> in a <a href=\"https://portal.ct.gov/ag/press-releases/2025-press-releases/purdue-pharma-and-sackler-family-settlement-in-principle\">press release</a>. \"Today, we're forcing Purdue and the Sackler family to pay for their role in one of the most devastating public health crises in American history.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Numerous U.S. states&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/07/21902857/15-states-settle-with-opioid-maker-purdue-pharma-for-4-5b-the-most-that-individuals-have-ever-pa\">have sued Purdue Pharma</a>&nbsp;for its aggressive&nbsp;marketing and for downplaying OxyContin&#8217;s&nbsp;addictiveness. Purdue essentially responded by&nbsp;declaring bankruptcy in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the new terms, per Tong's press release, Purdue Pharma will cease to operate under Sackler control. Over the next 15 years, $7.4 billion will be distributed to communities across the U.S. for opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery initiatives. Notably, the Sackler family will no longer be shielded from future lawsuits, a demand they previously insisted upon in earlier agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Relentless Pursuit Of Profit</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,&#8221; said New York Attorney General <strong>Letitia James</strong>, whose office helped negotiate the settlement agreement, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/purdue-pharma-sackler-families-boost-contribution-opioid-settlement/story?id=118015777\">reported</a> ABC News.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients, and played a critical role in starting and fueling in the opioid epidemic,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purdue Pharma's earlier settlement plan included a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/23/08/33748967/sackler-familys-6b-commitment-in-spotlight-supreme-court-suspends-purdue-pharmas-settlement-over-opi\">$6 billion contribution from the Sacklers</a> in exchange for immunity from all civil opioid claims, even though the family itself did not file for bankruptcy. The Supreme Court struck down that arrangement, asserting that the Sacklers could not use the company's bankruptcy to shield themselves from liability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A board of trustees will oversee Purdue&#8217;s future operations, ensuring it remains barred from opioid marketing or lobbying, noted Tong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purdue Pharma expressed satisfaction with the new settlement, in a statement to ABC News.

The order was issued at the behest of four Democratic-led states: Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The executive order instructed U.S. agencies to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. if neither parent is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. &#8220;I am having trouble understanding how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this order is constitutional,&#8221; Coughenour told a U.S. Justice Department lawyer defending the order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The states contended that Trump&#8217;s order contravenes the citizenship clause of the U.S. Constitution&#8217;s 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States. &#8220;This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,&#8221; Coughenour stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump said on Coughenour&#8217;s ruling, &#8220;Obviously we&#8217;ll appeal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The executive order was part of a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/01/43084601/trump-day-1-executive-order-tsunami-incoming-heres-what-hes-signing-first\">slew of actions</a> the president pledged to take immediately after his inauguration.

If Trump&#8217;s order is allowed to stand, more than 150,000 newborn children would be denied citizenship annually, according to the Democratic-led states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Congress Is Making Huge Investments. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/gov-trades\"><strong>Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/shivdeep-dhaliwal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shivdeep Dhaliwal</a></u></p>","authors":["Shivdeep Dhaliwal"],"teaser":"A federal judge temporarily blocked Trump&#39;s executive order limiting birthright citizenship, calling it &#34;blatantly unconstitutional.&#34;","url":"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/43181433/trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-halted-by-judge-blatantly-unconstitutional","tags":["Birthright Citizenship","Donald Trump","Edge Project","Shivdeep Dhaliwal","Trump"],"securities":[],"channels":["News","Politics","General"],"image":[{"size":"thumb","url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2025/01/23/Trump-Executive-Order-Limits-Federal-ID-.jpeg"},{"size":"small","url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2025/01/23/Trump-Executive-Order-Limits-Federal-ID-.jpeg"},{"size":"large","url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2025/01/23/Trump-Executive-Order-Limits-Federal-ID-.jpeg"}],"created_at":"2025-01-24T00:25:34.000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T00:25:34.000Z"},"timestamp":"2025-01-24T00:25:35.340Z"}}

This is the first such increase since July of last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Bank of Japan is optimistic that wage growth will sustain inflation around its 2% target, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/boj-likely-raise-rates-highest-17-years-signal-more-hikes-2025-01-23/\">Reuters</a> reported on Friday. The decision comes in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration, with potential tariff threats likely to keep policymakers vigilant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of a two-day meeting on Friday, the BOJ raised its short-term policy rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, a level not seen in Japan for 17 years. The decision, made by an 8-1 vote with board member Toyoaki Nakamura dissenting, underscores the central bank&#8217;s resolve to gradually elevate interest rates to around 1% &#8211; a level analysts believe will neither cool nor overheat Japan&#8217;s economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The likelihood of achieving the BOJ&#8217;s outlook has been rising,&#8221; the central bank said in a <a data-wplink-url-error=\"true\" href=\"http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2025/k250124a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, noting that many firms have indicated they will continue to steadily increase wages in this year&#8217;s annual wage negotiations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/43182172/boeing-nikola-texas-instruments-intuitive-surgical-and-tesla-why-these-5-stocks-are-on-investors-radars-today\">Boeing, Nikola, Texas Instruments, Intuitive Surgical, And Tesla: Why These 5 Stocks Are On Investors&#8217; Radars Today</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The Bank of Japan&#8217;s decision to raise interest rates is a significant development in the global financial landscape. The move indicates a level of confidence in the country&#8217;s economic stability and growth, despite potential external threats such as the new U.S. administration&#8217;s tariff policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rate hike also suggests that the BOJ is confident in its ability to manage inflation and maintain economic balance. The central bank&#8217;s statement indicates that many firms are planning to continue increasing wages, which could help sustain inflation around the 2% target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This development could have implications for other central banks and global markets, as they observe Japan&#8217;s approach to managing its economy amidst global uncertainties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo via Shutterstock.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/01/43182640/elizabeth-warren-lists-changes-for-elon-musks-doge-department-urges-guantanamo-closure-due-to-hundreds-of-millions-in-annual-costs\">Elizabeth Warren Lists Changes For Elon Musk&#8217;s DOGE Department, Urges Guantanamo Closure Due To &#8216;Hundreds of Millions&#8217; In Annual Costs</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<!--Actual content-->\n    <div style=\"font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif\">\n      <hr style=\"border: 0;height: 5px;background: #225aa9\">\n      <div style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;background-position: center;background-size: cover;justify-content: center\"></div>\n      <p style=\"font-family: sans-serif;padding-top: 20px\">\n        Engineered by\n        <span style=\"font-weight: bold;text-decoration: none;color: #225aa9;font-size: 1rem\">Benzinga Neuro</span>, Edited by\n        <span style=\"font-weight: bold;text-decoration: none;color: #225aa9;font-size: 1rem\">\n          <u><a href=\"None\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #225aa9;text-decoration: none\">\n              Jae Hur</a></u>\n        </span>\n      </p>\n      <hr style=\"border: 0;height: 1px;background: #225aa9\">\n      <p style=\"font-family: sans-serif;padding-top: 20px\">\n        The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the\n        extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to\n        create comprehensive and timely stories for you.\n        <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #225aa9;text-decoration: none\">Learn more.</a>\n      </p>\n      <hr style=\"border: 0;height: 5px;background: #225aa9\">\n    </div>\n    <!--Actual content end-->","authors":["Benzinga Neuro"],"teaser":"In a significant move, the Bank of Japan has hiked its interest rates to levels not seen since the global financial crisis of 2008 and in line with economists&#39; expectations.

Some respondents have already cited potential future tariffs as a reason for adjusting their inflation outlook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/25/01/42917321/consumer-inflation-worries-highest-since-2008-u-of-m-survey-says-wall-street-tumbles-to-2-month-lows\">Consumer Inflation Worries Highest Since 2008, U Of M Survey Says: Wall Street Tumbles To 2-Month Lows</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Power Of Inflation Expectations</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Economists widely agree that inflation expectations influence actual inflation. If businesses and consumers believe prices will rise, they may increase wages and adjust spending behaviors accordingly, creating a self-fulfilling cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs outlined two reasons why tariffs could have a larger effect on expectations now than during the 2018-2019 trade war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the potential tariff increases are expected to be larger than before. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the memory of recent inflation is still fresh. Research shows that people who have lived through high inflation are more likely to expect it to persist, reacting more aggressively to price changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salient price increases, such as gasoline, which consumers encounter daily, also tend to have an outsized effect on expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put it simply, if Americans believe that inflation is here to stay, their expectations could shift, triggering behaviors, such as businesses preemptively raising prices and workers demanding higher wages, that could keep inflation stubbornly high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs analyzed University of Michigan survey data, confirming that both recent and old inflation experiences strongly shape individuals&#8217; expectations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report found that consumers react more sharply to price changes in highly visible categories like gasoline, suggesting that widespread media coverage of tariff-driven price hikes could amplify inflation fears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Under a 10% across-the-board scenario in which the tariffs are highly salient to consumers, short-term inflation expectations would be 0.9pp higher and long-term inflation expectations would be 0.25pp higher than in the no-tariff case,&#8221; Abecasis wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Such a scenario might restrain the FOMC from cutting, though high public awareness of tariff-driven price increases might also restrain the White House from continuing to raise tariffs,&#8221; he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read now: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/25/01/43170854/trump-outlines-economic-reset-at-davos-5-things-you-need-to-know\">Trump Outlines Economic Reset At Davos: 5 Things You Need To Know</a></strong></li>\n</ul>","authors":["Piero Cingari"],"teaser":"Proposed tariff hikes by Trump could raise inflation expectations, making Fed&#39;s job of cutting interest rates trickier.

According to the survey, conducted between January 16 and January 19, 2025, only 4% of respondents trust the DEA to be an &#8220;unbiased proponent&#8221; for cannabis rescheduling efforts. An overwhelming 96% said they do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey sampled 677 frequent cannabis users from a list of respondents who opted into NuggMD&#8217;s polls. With a margin of error of ±3.77%, the poll reflects widespread skepticism among a demographic directly affected by cannabis policy. The results came shortly after a federal hearing on cannabis rescheduling <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42972524/dea-judge-cancels-marijuana-rescheduling-hearing-amid-disturbing-allegations-of-improper-conduct\">was delayed for several months</a>, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Consumer Trust In The DEA At Historic Lows</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>NuggMD, a company focused on medical cannabis evaluations and education, conducted the survey using first-party data from its consumer base. A spokesperson for the company emphasized the importance of this data in understanding public sentiment. &#8220;Cannabis consumers are the people most directly affected by federal cannabis prohibition, and the DEA has the power to enforce those laws,&#8221; said the company's head of communications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"When an agency you oversee polls at 4% with one of your stakeholder groups, you either have a policy problem, a personnel problem, or both. The current administration needs to choose which problem it has before it can solve it,\" the statement continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This level of distrust highlights a significant challenge for policymakers attempting to navigate cannabis reform. The DEA's reputation as a prohibitionist agency has long been a sticking point for advocates and these survey results suggest the agency may face an uphill battle in regaining credibility with key stakeholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Context: Delayed Rescheduling Hearing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The poll's timing is notable. It was conducted immediately after a federal hearing on rescheduling cannabis—a proposal that would shift the substance from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act—was put on hold. This delay has fueled frustrations within the cannabis community, where many see the DEA as a roadblock to meaningful reform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannabis remains classified as a Schedule I substance, alongside drugs like heroin, under federal law. This classification indicates a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, despite growing evidence and state-level legalization efforts. Rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III would significantly ease restrictions, potentially allowing for greater research, federal tax deductions and other benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Broader Implications</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The findings of the NuggMD poll reveal deeper tensions in the cannabis debate. For decades, the DEA has been viewed as resistant to reform, a perception that persists even as public opinion has shifted dramatically in favor of legalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These results also present an opportunity for the Biden administration, which has shown openness to reform. Addressing the mistrust highlighted by this poll could help the administration make meaningful strides in cannabis policy while rebuilding trust with stakeholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, the message from cannabis consumers is clear: the DEA has significant work to do in proving it can act as a neutral party in rescheduling discussions. Whether through policy changes, personnel shifts, or increased transparency, any attempt to rebuild trust will require swift and decisive action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now Read:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/25/01/43169554/trump-appoints-dea-chief-who-will-bring-ruthless-narco-terrorists-to-justice-not-keen-on-legalizing-cannabis\"><strong>Trump Appoints DEA Chief Who Will Bring &#8216;Ruthless Narco-Terrorists To Justice,&#8217; Not Keen On Legalizing Cannabis</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cover image made with AI</em></p>","authors":["Javier Hasse"],"teaser":"A NuggMD poll reveals only 4% of cannabis consumers trust the DEA to handle rescheduling fairly.","url":"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/25/01/43196674/96-of-cannabis-consumers-dont-trust-dea-on-rescheduling-efforts-poll","tags":["cannabis rescheduling","DEA","NuggMD","Survey"],"securities":[],"channels":["Cannabis","Legal"],"image":[{"size":"large","url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2025/01/24/Screen-Shot-2025-01-24-at-12-54-47.png"},{"size":"thumb","url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2025/01/24/Screen-Shot-2025-01-24-at-12-54-47.png"},{"size":"small","url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2025/01/24/Screen-Shot-2025-01-24-at-12-54-47.png"}],"created_at":"2025-01-24T16:34:30.000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:34:31.000Z"},"timestamp":"2025-01-24T16:34:31.754Z"}}

Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Donald Trump declared his intention to make the United States the &#8216;world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.&#8217; This commitment appeared to be not just in words but backed by some actions, such as appointing crypto-friendly officials to key roles and creating a crypto task force to establish clear regulations—raising high expectations. Adding to this, Trump sent a strong financial signal with a $47 million purchase of Bitcoin and Ethereum through his World Liberty Financial to mark his inauguration, amassing a total crypto portfolio valued at over $360 million. However, the recent launch of his and his wife's highly volatile and utility-less meme coins made the hearts of many in the industry sink and raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. Some even called it a slap in the face to those working hard to build real products in crypto and to an industry as a whole that had spent heavily to help Trump win. Are those hopes truly lost, or does the crypto market still have a bright future ahead? As the saying goes, hope dies last—so let's explore.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Controversial Journey of the $TRUMP Coin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The meme coin called $TRUMP appeared on Donald Trump's social media accounts ahead of his inauguration and quickly surged to become one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies. The price of a single $TRUMP token skyrocketed to $75.35. However, it sharply declined after the launch of $MELANIA coin, and as of this writing, $TRUMP trades at $34 with a market cap of $6.91 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Magnet for Scammers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with many high-profile crypto launches, the $TRUMP token became a prime target for opportunists and scammers. <a href=\"https://www.blockaid.io/blog/data-spotlight-how-scammers-reacted-to-the-trump-memecoin-token-launch\">According to Blockaid's report</a>, scammers wasted no time exploiting the buzz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day of the $TRUMP launch, the number of tokens bearing the \"Trump\" name skyrocketed by 206%, with over 6,800 new tokens deployed. Many were malicious, designed to mimic the official $TRUMP token and lure unsuspecting investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day after the launch, fake decentralized applications (dApps) using Trump's name increased by 14x, with 91 impersonator dApps launched within 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The schemes didn't stop at $TRUMP. Tokens bearing metadata linked to other Trump family members, such as \"Melania\" and \"Barron,\" surged by 592%, creating an illusion of an interconnected ecosystem to manipulate investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blockchain Transparency Exploitation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain transparency which allows anyone to send tokens to any wallet also facilitated speculative and opportunistic behavior. These wallets, presumably belonging to team members, market makers, or liquidity providers, became prime targets for opportunists who sent newly minted tokens to these addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, one wallet received 4 million $TRUMP tokens equivalent to $135.89 million at the current price. The sender is the crater of Milei (JMILEI) token.

The site also states that 200 million $TRUMP coins are currently available, with plans to issue a total of 1 billion tokens over a three-year period.

Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Donald Trump declared his intention to make the United States the &#8216;world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.&#8217; This commitment appeared to be not just in words but backed by some actions, such as appointing crypto-friendly officials to key roles and creating a crypto task force to establish clear regulations—raising high expectations. Adding to this, Trump sent a strong financial signal with a $47 million purchase of Bitcoin and Ethereum through his World Liberty Financial to mark his inauguration, amassing a total crypto portfolio valued at over $360 million. However, the recent launch of his and his wife's highly volatile and utility-less meme coins made the hearts of many in the industry sink and raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. Some even called it a slap in the face to those working hard to build real products in crypto and to an industry as a whole that had spent heavily to help Trump win. Are those hopes truly lost, or does the crypto market still have a bright future ahead? As the saying goes, hope dies last—so let's explore.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Controversial Journey of the $TRUMP Coin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The meme coin called $TRUMP appeared on Donald Trump's social media accounts ahead of his inauguration and quickly surged to become one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies. The price of a single $TRUMP token skyrocketed to $75.35. However, it sharply declined after the launch of $MELANIA coin, and as of this writing, $TRUMP trades at $34 with a market cap of $6.91 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Magnet for Scammers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with many high-profile crypto launches, the $TRUMP token became a prime target for opportunists and scammers. <a href=\"https://www.blockaid.io/blog/data-spotlight-how-scammers-reacted-to-the-trump-memecoin-token-launch\">According to Blockaid's report</a>, scammers wasted no time exploiting the buzz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day of the $TRUMP launch, the number of tokens bearing the \"Trump\" name skyrocketed by 206%, with over 6,800 new tokens deployed. Many were malicious, designed to mimic the official $TRUMP token and lure unsuspecting investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day after the launch, fake decentralized applications (dApps) using Trump's name increased by 14x, with 91 impersonator dApps launched within 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The schemes didn't stop at $TRUMP. Tokens bearing metadata linked to other Trump family members, such as \"Melania\" and \"Barron,\" surged by 592%, creating an illusion of an interconnected ecosystem to manipulate investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blockchain Transparency Exploitation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain transparency which allows anyone to send tokens to any wallet also facilitated speculative and opportunistic behavior. These wallets, presumably belonging to team members, market makers, or liquidity providers, became prime targets for opportunists who sent newly minted tokens to these addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, one wallet received 4 million $TRUMP tokens equivalent to $135.89 million at the current price. The sender is the crater of Milei (JMILEI) token. Solscan <a href=\"https://dexscreener.com/solana/3xqwPRTbbrTA83Uy45YDQoieZ7PCfqUSqhKbgKSBDrf6\">reveals</a> how Milei was quickly sold with high trading activity during the initial pump.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd6TQ-i0firrY-4kk4QCHofYiQMgkdjqA0MzLrvDIDfrvdcLvBLoS7bw4IbruxYc5c65qNyJDIisIKVemyoNqrRJh1CThaNw2WHW0JS_lgSec13jSZZfbfgA7LksST6W9NoOn5ZVw?key=o2b4zAWTNcK09cd_1y9oy60E\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: Solscan.io</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://solscan.io/account/2RH6rUTPBJ9rUDPpuV9b8z1YL56k1tYU6Uk5ZoaEFFSK#portfolio\">Other wallet</a> with substantial $TRUMP holdings is currently flooded with over 500 different coins, including the X token. <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc0OflvrPTDaC2UxVKptTUujsrKeeTiweQqy2JgSg1z0SvPHA6E_vxMrXWkeYQKAlY1Cqq0W4C_GVXKnwXDDaIrBsx3d0Uh5s0x-zXjwL3Uhae_rMpv0YQyqF5he0w0HW187g6oaQ?key=o2b4zAWTNcK09cd_1y9oy60E\" width=\"624\" height=\"423\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: Solscan.io</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the Trump coin launch, the X token also experienced significant trading activity, with transactions reaching a total volume of $698K in the past 24 hours. At a current price of $0.009623, some tokens were sold at their peak during the post-Trump pump, generating impressive returns. The market cap of X token now stands at $9.5M, with 3,141 recorded transactions and an evenly distributed buy and sell volume of $349K each.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcewARpy33hmmlYbc_3bAHEeaJYKZZOzE2dXF_eiHkGbpWw4oidPF6Vn1_g31nbUwEou39mg6Oy1XNBW8-xrTBBjN9cLpFT-d0ivgoCEYX_2XutPvkPvnWSFqth-japffEkVBKeQA?key=o2b4zAWTNcK09cd_1y9oy60E\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: Dexscreener.com</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sale of $TRUMP meme coins was organized by CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of the Trump Organization.

The site also states that 200 million $TRUMP coins are currently available, with plans to issue a total of 1 billion tokens over a three-year period. Notably, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC collectively hold 80% of the token supply, subject to a three-year unlocking schedule, and will receive revenue from trading activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcEyp2MtUn_cPMUWknuB_4m6J35b3UU_WDfbTr4hayS0d_5t1fOu6zz6icNTEScDgWoR5O8-RF7AiLbdiFHoVXdHHbhBVmD8aNfnOxQmMo1b1bLSuI5ZVzCSQMQAyU1QJ2x5IC3-w?key=o2b4zAWTNcK09cd_1y9oy60E\" alt=\"Image\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: GetTrumpMemes.com</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a January 21 press conference, Trump appeared to downplay his role in the project, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkT4bPEQCjc\">saying</a>, <em>\"I don't know much about it other than I launched.

Plus, the damage figures don't account for spreading blazes in San Diego over the past week, adding to the total property damage and loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what this means for insurance stocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The destruction caused by these fires is anticipated to be the most expensive in the state's history with effects on the insurance industry that will persist into the future,\" says Tom Larsen, senior director of CoreLogic Insurance Solutions This event highlights the paramount challenge for homeowners and the insurers that support them – the increasing density of homes and properties near the wildlife-urban-interface.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance companies have some built-in protection against substantial financial losses from the LA fires, but it's not nearly enough to avoid an economic tsunami, insurance experts say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Insurers heavily exposed to California rely primarily on reinsurance agreements to limit their risk,\" says Michael Benoit, a licensed insurance broker and founder of San Diego-based California Contractor Bond &amp; Insurance Services. \"Reinsurance helps these companies distribute their major claim costs so they can manage losses better during big disasters.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under their reinsurance programs, Farmers and Allstate protect themselves from large losses by sharing 90% of claims above specific thresholds. \"Basically, the system protects insurers from financial collapse during severe wildfire seasons,\" Benoit says.<br><br>However, reinsurance comes with rising costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The expenses of reinsurance protection have risen by double digits each year because wildfire hazards become more severe,\" Benoit notes. \"Insurers lower risk exposure by imposing stricter underwriting standards that decrease policy benefits and demand higher out-of-pocket payments from clients living in dangerous areas. While these measures reduce direct exposure, they often leave homeowners vulnerable, which could affect customer retention in the long run.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insurance Stocks To Sell or Avoid For Now</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance stocks with the highest exposure are those tied to Farmers Insurance Group, State Farm, Allstate, and Mercury General, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"That's because these companies have their largest property policy operations in California,\" Benoit says. \"These big insurance companies have operated in Southern California for many years and generate a lot of business from places that often experience wildfires.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, that strategy has backfired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Companies with this level of regional dependency face significant challenges during events like the billion-dollar LA wildfire loss,\" Benoit says. \"Their exposure to record claims erodes profitability quickly because they lack the geographic diversification necessary to offset the losses. Insurers with a more balanced portfolio, such as Travelers or Hartford, can spread the impact across less affected regions, creating a cushion that companies focused primarily on California often don't have.\"<br><br>Given that problematic background, investors worried about portfolio risk may want to consider shedding or paring down the insurance portion of their stock portfolios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If so, these sector companies may lead that \"sell\" list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/premium/ideas/benzinga-edge/?utm_source=RD-0127&amp;el=ResearchDaily&amp;he={{email}}&amp;adt_ei={{email}}\">Five Under-Followed Stocks With Potential to Move This Week</a></strong>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mercury General (MCY</strong>). This LA-based insurer's stock price has plummeted by 24.65% year to date as of January 24, and its exposure to the wildfires is by far the biggest reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Mercury General holds a 6.1% share of the homeowners insurance market in that region, with nearly 80% of its premiums last year coming from the state, which leaves it particularly vulnerable during extreme wildfire seasons,\" Benoit says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary saving grace for MCY going forward is that rising property insurance valuations will eventually resupply cash reserves, but that scenario may be too distant for shell-shocked investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Allstate (ALL).</strong> While Allstate has done a job of mitigating California wildfire risk by curbing new home insurance policies in the state, it's a good example of a sector company that can't afford any more bad news – but that's exactly what's happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 13, the state of Texas sued Allstate subsidiary Arity over alleged illegal consumer mobile phone tracking without user consent. &nbsp;That practice runs against Texas' comprehensive data privacy law as the state attorney general's office charges Allstate with using that consumer data to justify raising insurance rates (Allstate has denied the charges).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That double-dose of bad news could be enough to give shareholders pause for a stock that's already down 4.25% on a year-to-date basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cincinnati Financial (CINF).</strong> This Fairfield, Ohio-based insurance company has historically done plenty of business in California, although, like some of its peers, it has stopped writing homeowner insurance policies in the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That policy has limited CINF's wildfire losses, contributing to keeping share losses down to only 5% in 2025. Still, the company has enough current LA homeowner policies in higher-valued homes that could lead to significant financial losses. That's one reason why Bank of America (BofA) recently pegged the company's earnings-per-share decline at 20% in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Takeaway on Insurance Company Stocks and the California Fires</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prudence is always well-advised, and investors should talk over any insurance company-related portfolio moves with a trusted financial advisor. Still, a candid insurance stock talk is a conversation worth having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Right now, I&#8217;d lean toward holding or even buying cautiously for select insurers with strong fundamentals and robust risk management strategies,\" says Eamonn Turley, CEO of UK-based Multi Quote Time, an insurance company cost comparison platform. \"While short-term losses due to wildfire claims are inevitable for companies like Allstate and Chubb, these events often lead to premium increases and stricter underwriting practices in high-risk areas, which can improve profitability in the long term.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, for insurers without clear reinsurance strategies or excessive exposure to Southern California properties, Turley says he's \"more inclined to sell or avoid altogether until the dust settles.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week, Benzinga's Stock Whisper Index uses proprietary data and pattern recognition to showcase five under-the-radar stocks that warrant your immediate attention. <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/premium/ideas/benzinga-edge/?utm_source=WebRD-0127&amp;el=ResearchDaily&amp;he={{email}}&amp;adt_ei={{email}}\">Get access to these stocks right here.</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image via Wikimedia Commons</p>","authors":["Benzinga Research Team"],"teaser":"Massive wildfires in LA have caused financial damage of $35-45 billion, affecting homeowners and insurance companies.

However, Green is barred from buying a gun because of his status as a medical marijuana patient.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ongoing Cases</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The current patchwork of rulings across the country highlights the growing tension between marijuana legalization efforts and federal gun laws. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/08/33719970/federal-court-strikes-down-gun-prohibition-for-cannabis-users-as-unconstitutional">dealt a major blow</a> to the ban in 2022, declaring it unconstitutional as applied to a man who used cannabis while possessing a gun. This put the Justice Department on the defensive, prompting multiple appeals and pushing the issue closer to the nation&#8217;s highest court.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Three cases pending before the Supreme Court could potentially settle the dispute once and for all. One involves a federal government appeal of the Fifth Circuit ruling, another centers on a similar case from Maryland and the third stems from a New York man&#8217;s challenge to the ban.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second Amendment At The Center Of The Battle</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of the legal battle lies the Second Amendment&#8217;s historical context. The plaintiffs argue that no historical precedent justifies disarming a person for using a substance legal in many states, while the Justice Department points to past restrictions on gun ownership for dangerous people such as the mentally ill and habitually drunk.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hunter Biden Thrown Into The Mix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the ongoing <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/12/36211739/hunter-biden-lawyers-argue-millions-in-legal-marijuana-states-violate-fed-gun-laws-raising-uncon">case against Hunter Biden</a>, accused of gun possession despite past drug use. This high-profile example has thrust the issue into the national spotlight, further amplifying calls for reform.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With legal battles escalating and public debate intensifying, the question of whether medical marijuana patients can exercise their Second Amendment rights seems poised for a showdown. Whether the Supreme Court will definitively decide the matter, or Congress steps in to address the conflict, the stakes keep getting higher for millions of Americans caught in the crossfire.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Read next:<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36727075/can-marijuana-use-cost-you-your-right-to-bear-arms-supreme-court-poised-to-weigh-on-cannabis-sec"> Can Marijuana Use Cost You Your Right To Bear Arms?

Here are five valuable lessons learned from losing traders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Avoiding Undercapitalization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A common issue among losing traders is starting with insufficient capital, which limits their ability to absorb early losses. These traders often find themselves pressured to take high-risk trades to quickly recoup losses or generate significant profits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson here is the necessity of adequate capitalization. It provides a buffer against initial losses and allows traders to make decisions based on strategy rather than desperation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-capitalized trader has the resilience to withstand market fluctuations and stay in the game long enough to find success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Recognizing The Limitations Of Backtesting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often rely heavily on historical backtesting of their strategies without considering their limitations. While backtesting is a valuable tool, it sometimes gives a false sense of security as past performance is not always indicative of future results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine backtesting with forward-testing in real market conditions and remain cautious about over-optimizing strategies based on historical data alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Perils Of Overtrading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A frequent mistake of unsuccessful traders is overtrading — making too many trades in an attempt to recover from losses or capitalize on every perceived opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This often results in increased transaction costs and heightened exposure to risk. Focus on quality over quantity. Successful trading is about making well-considered and well-timed trades based on sound analysis, not about the frequency of trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Misjudging Market Correlation And Diversification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some losing traders misunderstand the concept of diversification, holding multiple assets that, unbeknownst to them, are highly correlated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turbulent market conditions, these correlated assets can all move in the same unfavorable direction, leading to significant losses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no replacement for understanding and managing market correlations. Effective diversification involves investing in assets with varying correlations to mitigate risk across different market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Ignoring The Psychological Aspect Of Losses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often overlook the psychological impact of their losses, leading to a detrimental cycle of doubt, fear and erratic decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must go into your career as a proper trader understanding the importance of psychological resilience and self-awareness. Acknowledging and learning from losses, rather than being demoralized by them, is a must.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing a mindset that views losses as an opportunity to learn and improve can be transformative for a trader&#8217;s approach and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember this: Every prop trader will make losing investments. It\'s part of the process. Your goal is to learn from your losses — and those of others — to maximize future gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

Toeing this line, but never crossing it, is essential to turning a profit over the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn a lot from successful prop traders, including the four lessons below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Risk Management Is Paramount</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful prop traders prioritize risk management above all else. They understand that preserving capital is as crucial as generating profits. This involves setting strict stop-loss limits, diversifying trades and not over-leveraging positions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By controlling the downside, they ensure that losses are manageable and do not cripple their trading capital. This approach is about playing the long game, recognizing that staying in the market is more important than short-term gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about how much they make on winning trades but how little they lose on the losing ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Adaptability To Market Conditions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Top prop traders excel in their ability to adapt to changing market conditions. They understand that strategies effective in one market environment may not work in another. These traders continuously analyze market trends, economic indicators and geopolitical events, adjusting their strategies accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility in trading styles — whether it&#8217;s shifting from short-term scalping to long-term trend following or from technical analysis to fundamental analysis — is a key differentiator. This adaptability prevents them from becoming overly committed to a single approach and allows them to capitalize on various market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Continuous Learning And Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial markets are constantly evolving and so must a prop trader&#8217;s skillset. Successful traders commit to lifelong learning, constantly updating their knowledge and refining their strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This involves staying abreast of the latest financial news, technological advancements in trading platforms and evolving market theories. It also includes learning from past trades, both successful and unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a process of continuous self-evaluation and education, these traders maintain a competitive edge and stay relevant in the ever-changing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Emotional Discipline And Patience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emotional control and patience are critical traits of successful prop traders. Maintaining composure under pressure and avoiding emotional decision-making distinguishes top traders from wannabees. They resist the urge to chase losses or become overconfident after a series of wins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This emotional discipline is coupled with patience and understanding that opportunities will present themselves, and not every market movement warrants a trade. These traders know that sometimes the best action is no action at all, and they wait for high-probability setups instead of succumbing to the temptation of overtrading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no such thing as guaranteed success in prop trading — or anything else in life. It\'s earned every day. When you follow this advice, it can tilt the investing scales in your favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

With an initial investment of $300, she set out to conquer the world of trading. &#8220;My first goal was to supplement that side hustle, so literally it&#8217;s like if I can just make five, six hundred a week and replace, you know, Lyft and Uber, then that&#8217;s already great for me,&#8221; Amores said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores set a clear goal: to earn weekly what she was previously earning bi-weekly at her job. By doing this, she said she was earning two to three months of salary in just one month. Within six months, she had saved a year&#8217;s salary, enabling her to leave her job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a single mother with family responsibilities, Amores emphasized the importance of cautious planning. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t just leave my job and hope for the best. I had to be prepared and ensure I had a safety net for my family,&#8221; she said, highlighting the balance she had to maintain between personal ambition and family responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the interview, Amores emphasized the importance of continuous learning and seeking mentorship. Her approach to trading is methodical, focusing on building a strong foundation before scaling up. She highlighted the critical role of risk management, saying, &#8220;Risk management only works if you&#8217;re following it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She stressed the importance of learning from verified sources. &#8220;The main thing I always say is to try to learn from a vetted person,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This means having some proof that they are who they say they are. It saves you time and headaches. You don&#8217;t want to attempt a master strategy, only to find that they&#8217;re teaching beginner-level material when you&#8217;re at an intermediate or advanced level.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amore&#8217;s journey is marked by her transition from trading small, personal accounts to managing large funds.

Defense attorney <strong>Clifford Robert </strong>responded on Wednesday, calling the comparison &#8220;misplaced and irresponsible.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert argued that Trump&#8217;s fraud case lacks witnesses, complaints, and victims compared to Shkreli&#8217;s case. He also warned of the &#8220;sobering future consequences&#8221; of the Attorney General&#8217;s &#8220;shameless abuse of power.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump attorney <strong>Chris Kise</strong> reportedly said that the ruling in Trump&#8217;s case could have far-reaching implications for the New York business community. He urged major bank CEOs and Wall Street participants to speak out against the Attorney General&#8217;s &#8220;shocking and tyrannical interference in the capital markets.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36710420/paul-krugman-blames-ron-desantiss-anti-vax-crusade-for-thousands-of-deaths-musk-reacts-you-give-econ?itm_source=parsely-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Krugman Blames Ron Desantis&#8217;s Anti-Vax Crusade For Thousands Of Deaths, Musk Reacts: &#8216;You Give Economics A Bad Name&#8217;</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The comparison to Shkreli, who was recently <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/24/01/36754161/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-cannot-return-to-drug-industry-ever-court-upholds-lifetime-ban">banned for life</a> from the pharmaceutical industry, is significant.

Trump\'s 75% of the vote in the poll also marks a new full-week high since polling began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has been dominant in the poll of national Republican voters in recent weeks and the results in Iowa and New Hampshire shouldn\'t come as a huge surprise. Trump posted a lead of 50 points or more in multiple consecutive weeks in the national poll of Republican voters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis gained a percentage point before dropping out and was tied for second with Haley at 12% of the vote in the last poll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haley saw her support remain at 12% and she moved into a tie with DeSantis after previously topping him by one percentage point. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad news for Haley could be the poll\'s data pointing to Trump benefitting from DeSantis dropping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the voters who selected DeSantis as their top candidate, 57% selected Trump as their next pick. Thirty-five percent of voters who picked DeSantis listed Haley as their second choice and the rest picked someone else or were unsure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could suggest that Trump could add around 6% of DeSantis\'s 12% support with Haley adding 4%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new poll also found Trump had a favorable rating of 81% and an unfavorable rating of 18%. Both of these figures were an improvement from the prior week\'s totals of 77% and 21%, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis\'s favorable and unfavorable ratings were 63% and 23% respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haley had a favorable rating of 47% and an unfavorable rating of 32%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After her second-place finish in New Hampshire, Haley has vowed to stay in the Republican presidential race.

They proved to be a once-popular way for companies to go public but often drew the attention of regulators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many companies that went public via SPAC trading have since delisted or gone bankrupt. Now, the SEC has decided to enact several new rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC, led by SEC Chairman <strong>Gary Gensler, </strong>voted 3-2 Wednesday on new rules. They&#8217;re expected to be enacted within five months, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/sec-wants-to-make-sure-spac-investors-know-what-theyre-getting-into-510aca30">to</a> the Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the new rule changes are more disclosures from the companies ahead of the offering and executives being held liable for the claims made. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concerns over dilution for SPAC mergers will be more present in filings. Disclosures and tables should show who owns shares and when they can sell them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big difference between SPACs and IPOs was often the forward guidance. SPAC presentations of deal announcements often included revenue and earnings estimates multiple years into the future. In many cases since, those estimates proved to be wildly inaccurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conflicts of interest between sponsors, affiliates and shareholders will also have to be disclosed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>"Whether you are doing a traditional IPO or a SPAC target IPO, SPAC investors are no less deserving of our time-tested investor presentations," Gensler said, according to a Reuters report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/23/03/31180908/chamath-palihapitiya-says-spacs-were-fueled-by-a-moment-in-time-of-just-enormous-liquidity-whats-nex">Chamath Palihapitiya Says SPACs Were &#8216;Fueled By A Moment In Time Of Just Enormous Liquidity&#8217;: What&#8217;s Next For Private Companies?</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It\'s Important:</strong> Over 800 SPACs raised $246 billion in 2020 and 2021, according to data from <a href="https://www.spacinsider.com/">SPACInsider </a>cited by the WSJ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the popular sectors that often saw SPAC mergers were sports betting, space, eVTOLs and e-commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rules to add disclosures and investor protections have been in the works for years.

It obtained the data through Trump\'s financial filings and disclosures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the ETH comes from royalties for non-fungible token (NFT) projects that Trump created. In December 2022, Trump released a set of 45,000 NFTs, each priced at $99. The project has amassed trading volumes of over $35 million or 15,000 ETH.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NFTs are largely trading above their original price of $99. As of Jan. 19, the cheapest NFT is listed for over $600 and the highest sale was for 37 ETH.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deloitte\'s fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart &amp; Target – </strong><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/mode-mobile-2"><strong>Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art — </strong><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/masterworks"><strong>this alternative asset has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%.

Some of the potential perks could be dinner with the former president, or even a small piece of fabric from the suit he wore in his Georgia mugshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Trump and his companies are not directly associated with these NFT projects. NFT International created and distributed the NFTs and uses Trump\'s "name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Digital LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms."</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump sold 1,075 ETH for over $2.4 million through Coinbase.. At its peak, it was worth more than $4 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sale comes after a strong month for Ethereum. The price was up more than 17% in the month leading up to the sale, 30% in the six months before and 60% over the past year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though Trump said during his presidency that he was "not a fan" of Bitcoin and that crypto is a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/09/22753280/former-us-president-donald-trump-crypto-is-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen">"disaster waiting to happen,"</a> it is hard to pass on several million dollars.

However, Green is barred from buying a gun because of his status as a medical marijuana patient.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ongoing Cases</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The current patchwork of rulings across the country highlights the growing tension between marijuana legalization efforts and federal gun laws. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/08/33719970/federal-court-strikes-down-gun-prohibition-for-cannabis-users-as-unconstitutional">dealt a major blow</a> to the ban in 2022, declaring it unconstitutional as applied to a man who used cannabis while possessing a gun. This put the Justice Department on the defensive, prompting multiple appeals and pushing the issue closer to the nation&#8217;s highest court.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Three cases pending before the Supreme Court could potentially settle the dispute once and for all. One involves a federal government appeal of the Fifth Circuit ruling, another centers on a similar case from Maryland and the third stems from a New York man&#8217;s challenge to the ban.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second Amendment At The Center Of The Battle</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of the legal battle lies the Second Amendment&#8217;s historical context. The plaintiffs argue that no historical precedent justifies disarming a person for using a substance legal in many states, while the Justice Department points to past restrictions on gun ownership for dangerous people such as the mentally ill and habitually drunk.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hunter Biden Thrown Into The Mix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the ongoing <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/12/36211739/hunter-biden-lawyers-argue-millions-in-legal-marijuana-states-violate-fed-gun-laws-raising-uncon">case against Hunter Biden</a>, accused of gun possession despite past drug use.

Since 2018, Elfenbein has been outperforming renowned investment figures such as <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31496603/warren-buffett-has-held-this-stock-for-over-34-years-why-he-will-never-sell">Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</a> and ARK Invest, thanks to his unique <a href="https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/news2/a-finance-blogger-has-outperformed-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-and-cathie-woods-ark-invest-since-2018-by-filling-his-etf-with-boring-stocks/986902/">"set and hold"</a> approach. This method involves creating a &#8220;buy list&#8221; of 25 stocks at the start of each year for his exchange-traded fund <strong>AdvisorShares Focused Equity ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CWS#NYSE">CWS</a>) and maintaining it unchanged for the entire year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elfenbein&#8217;s investment philosophy is grounded in discipline and long-term thinking. By not engaging in frequent trading, his strategy diverges from common practices in the investment world. The AdvisorShares ETF has achieved a return of 110% since its inception, significantly outshining the 74% and 45% returns of Berkshire Hathaway and ARK Innovation Fund, respectively. Typically, the fund&#8217;s holdings remain steady throughout the year, with occasional adjustments to a maximum of five stocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Elfenbein&#8217;s innovative &#8220;fulcrum fee&#8221; structure in the ETF aligns his interests with those of the investors, rewarding him for outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and benefiting investors if the fund underperforms. This model underscores Elfenbein&#8217;s view of investors as partners, sharing in both the successes and challenges of the fund. Such transparency and aligned incentives have positioned CWS as a pioneering fund in the ETF landscape\u200b\u200b.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 buy list includes companies with strong market positions and competitive advantages, such as The Hershey Co., Intuit Inc., Moody\'s Investors Service, HEICO Corp. and Silgan Holdings, with long-standing investments like Aflac Inc. Elfenbein focuses on long-term investments, with an average holding period of five years for each stock, highlighting his commitment to stability and growth over immediate returns. His buy list has achieved an 18-year compound gain of 573%, exceeding the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 447% return in the same timeframe\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elfenbein&#8217;s strategy offers a contrast to <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding">proprietary trading</a>, which is characterized by its dynamic, high-risk nature. Elfenbein&#8217;s set-and-hold strategy appeals to investors seeking steady, long-term growth, while proprietary trading attracts those looking for quicker, potentially higher returns despite the increased risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Jan. 10 interview on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4etnDEZFLGaQ091lJ5Kf9b">Downtown Josh Brown&#8217;s podcast</a> &#8220;The Compound and Friends,&#8221; Elfenbein eloquently summarized his investment approach: &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do a lot of trading. You don&#8217;t have to be in and out. You don&#8217;t have to get well-known growth stock names. You can get a sort of a boring portfolio, set and hold it and be disciplined and do very well.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This philosophy reflects his belief in the power of a disciplined, low-maintenance approach to achieve substantial market returns. Elfenbein encapsulated his method: &#8220;We&#8217;re as lazy as possible. That&#8217;s the goal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elfenbein&#8217;s success with the ETF, which is closing in on $100 million in assets under management, demonstrates the effectiveness of a disciplined, low-maintenance investment approach in the modern financial world. His method challenges traditional trading practices and offers an appealing alternative for investors seeking stable, long-term growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

Here are five valuable lessons learned from losing traders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Avoiding Undercapitalization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A common issue among losing traders is starting with insufficient capital, which limits their ability to absorb early losses. These traders often find themselves pressured to take high-risk trades to quickly recoup losses or generate significant profits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson here is the necessity of adequate capitalization. It provides a buffer against initial losses and allows traders to make decisions based on strategy rather than desperation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-capitalized trader has the resilience to withstand market fluctuations and stay in the game long enough to find success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Recognizing The Limitations Of Backtesting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often rely heavily on historical backtesting of their strategies without considering their limitations. While backtesting is a valuable tool, it sometimes gives a false sense of security as past performance is not always indicative of future results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine backtesting with forward-testing in real market conditions and remain cautious about over-optimizing strategies based on historical data alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Perils Of Overtrading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A frequent mistake of unsuccessful traders is overtrading — making too many trades in an attempt to recover from losses or capitalize on every perceived opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This often results in increased transaction costs and heightened exposure to risk. Focus on quality over quantity. Successful trading is about making well-considered and well-timed trades based on sound analysis, not about the frequency of trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Misjudging Market Correlation And Diversification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some losing traders misunderstand the concept of diversification, holding multiple assets that, unbeknownst to them, are highly correlated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turbulent market conditions, these correlated assets can all move in the same unfavorable direction, leading to significant losses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no replacement for understanding and managing market correlations. Effective diversification involves investing in assets with varying correlations to mitigate risk across different market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Ignoring The Psychological Aspect Of Losses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often overlook the psychological impact of their losses, leading to a detrimental cycle of doubt, fear and erratic decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must go into your career as a proper trader understanding the importance of psychological resilience and self-awareness. Acknowledging and learning from losses, rather than being demoralized by them, is a must.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing a mindset that views losses as an opportunity to learn and improve can be transformative for a trader&#8217;s approach and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember this: Every prop trader will make losing investments. It\'s part of the process. Your goal is to learn from your losses — and those of others — to maximize future gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

Toeing this line, but never crossing it, is essential to turning a profit over the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn a lot from successful prop traders, including the four lessons below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Risk Management Is Paramount</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful prop traders prioritize risk management above all else. They understand that preserving capital is as crucial as generating profits. This involves setting strict stop-loss limits, diversifying trades and not over-leveraging positions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By controlling the downside, they ensure that losses are manageable and do not cripple their trading capital. This approach is about playing the long game, recognizing that staying in the market is more important than short-term gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about how much they make on winning trades but how little they lose on the losing ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Adaptability To Market Conditions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Top prop traders excel in their ability to adapt to changing market conditions. They understand that strategies effective in one market environment may not work in another. These traders continuously analyze market trends, economic indicators and geopolitical events, adjusting their strategies accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility in trading styles — whether it&#8217;s shifting from short-term scalping to long-term trend following or from technical analysis to fundamental analysis — is a key differentiator. This adaptability prevents them from becoming overly committed to a single approach and allows them to capitalize on various market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Continuous Learning And Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial markets are constantly evolving and so must a prop trader&#8217;s skillset. Successful traders commit to lifelong learning, constantly updating their knowledge and refining their strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This involves staying abreast of the latest financial news, technological advancements in trading platforms and evolving market theories. It also includes learning from past trades, both successful and unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a process of continuous self-evaluation and education, these traders maintain a competitive edge and stay relevant in the ever-changing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Emotional Discipline And Patience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emotional control and patience are critical traits of successful prop traders. Maintaining composure under pressure and avoiding emotional decision-making distinguishes top traders from wannabees. They resist the urge to chase losses or become overconfident after a series of wins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This emotional discipline is coupled with patience and understanding that opportunities will present themselves, and not every market movement warrants a trade. These traders know that sometimes the best action is no action at all, and they wait for high-probability setups instead of succumbing to the temptation of overtrading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no such thing as guaranteed success in prop trading — or anything else in life. It\'s earned every day. When you follow this advice, it can tilt the investing scales in your favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

With an initial investment of $300, she set out to conquer the world of trading. &#8220;My first goal was to supplement that side hustle, so literally it&#8217;s like if I can just make five, six hundred a week and replace, you know, Lyft and Uber, then that&#8217;s already great for me,&#8221; Amores said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores set a clear goal: to earn weekly what she was previously earning bi-weekly at her job. By doing this, she said she was earning two to three months of salary in just one month. Within six months, she had saved a year&#8217;s salary, enabling her to leave her job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a single mother with family responsibilities, Amores emphasized the importance of cautious planning. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t just leave my job and hope for the best. I had to be prepared and ensure I had a safety net for my family,&#8221; she said, highlighting the balance she had to maintain between personal ambition and family responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the interview, Amores emphasized the importance of continuous learning and seeking mentorship. Her approach to trading is methodical, focusing on building a strong foundation before scaling up. She highlighted the critical role of risk management, saying, &#8220;Risk management only works if you&#8217;re following it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She stressed the importance of learning from verified sources. &#8220;The main thing I always say is to try to learn from a vetted person,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This means having some proof that they are who they say they are. It saves you time and headaches. You don&#8217;t want to attempt a master strategy, only to find that they&#8217;re teaching beginner-level material when you&#8217;re at an intermediate or advanced level.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amore&#8217;s journey is marked by her transition from trading small, personal accounts to managing large funds. This progression included experiences with percentage allocation management module (PAMM) accounts for forex and proprietary trading. Reflecting on her experiences, Amores said, &#8220;The thing about trading other people&#8217;s money taught me accountability.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking played a significant role in Amores\'s career. She acknowledged the power of building connections and being open to new opportunities. &#8220;You never know who you&#8217;re talking to,&#8221; she said, underscoring the potential of networking to open doors to larger trading opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores\'s trading strategy centers around liquidity, volume and high-probability setups. She approaches the market with a keen eye for where liquidity is and how it&#8217;s redistributed. &#8220;I&#8217;m always trading in line with liquidity,&#8221; she said, illustrating her tactical approach to trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The psychological aspects of trading are not lost on Amores. She discussed the importance of mindset, visualization and handling the pressures associated with trading large sums of money. Amores has learned to manage these challenges gracefully, contributing to her overall success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores has set ambitious goals for herself, including trading multimillion-dollar accounts and eventually reaching billion-dollar allocations. Her story is not just about financial success; it&#8217;s about overcoming challenges and pursuing one&#8217;s goals, making her an inspiration to aspiring traders worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

I have long believed that as a country we need to get the right people in the same room and open the floor for discussion without the distraction of narrative building and publicity, much like a modern-day (and somewhat less consequential) version of the Manhattan Project.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I personally view Idaho Strategic as the tip of the spear in terms of addressing the U.S.&#39;s rare earth elements demand. My participation on the Industry R&amp;D Needs panel is fitting and I am looking forward to a productive discussion while working our way one step closer to a real solution,&quot; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. <strong>Freeport-McMoRan Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FCX#NYSE">FCX</a>) reported fourth quarter and full-year results for 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company exceeded its October 2023 estimates in copper sales volumes and managed to keep unit net cash costs lower than expected and lower than in Q4 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Net income for Q4 2023 was $388 million, equating to 27 cents per share, while adjusted net income, excluding net charges, was $393 million (also 27 cents per share).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Q4 2023, the company produced 1.1 billion pounds of copper, 573 thousand ounces of gold, and 20 million pounds of molybdenum.

In fact, the stock may continue to test lower near-term trading levels if Tesla cannot restore confidence in its growth outlook, the analyst said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst opined that the company offered little details on its forward-year outlook. While the company said that its volumes will be &#8216;notably lower&#8217; in 2024 as compared to the last year, it did not specify a percentage. Jonas expects delivery growth to fall to 15% in 2024, less than half of the 38% growth it achieved in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the analyst continues to not bet against the company&#8217;s share price owing to the potential for an AI wildcard through the year and the capex guidance of at least $10 billion in FY24, higher than Morgan Stanley&#8217;s estimate of around $8.5 billion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the earnings call, company CEO<strong> Elon Musk</strong> suggested the possibility of an update on AI later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Change In Estimates:</strong> While retaining their price target, Jonas <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36771860/teslas-energy-segment-faces-q4-dip-as-automotive-grew-but-elon-musk-led-company-expects-trend-revers">decreased their Tesla revenue estimates</a> for FY24 to $106 billion on the back of lower expected auto revenue. However, the analyst now forecasts slightly higher automotive gross profit in the coming year of $13.3 billion and slightly higher operating margin with FY24 at 5.9% and FY25 at 8.3%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:\xa0</strong>Tesla shares closed down 0.6% at $207.83 on Wednesday and fell about 6% after hours, according to\xa0<a href="https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data from Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo via Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga\'s Future Of Mobility coverage by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mobility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following this link</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong></em> <em><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36771860/teslas-energy-segment-faces-q4-dip-as-automotive-grew-but-elon-musk-led-company-expects-trend-revers">Tesla&#8217;s Energy Segment Faces Q4 Dip As Automotive Grew, But Elon Musk-Led Company Expects Trend Reversal In 2024</a></em></p>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36771989/tesla-bull-adam-jonas-says-q4-conference-call-provided-no-information-to-disrupt-prevailing-sentimen', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/Tesla-stock_6.jpeg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/Tesla-stock_6.jpeg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/Tesla-stock_6.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'News'}, {'name': 'Top Stories'}, {'name': 'Analyst Ratings'}, {'name': 'Tech'}], 'stocks': [{'name': 'TSLA'}], 'tags': [{'name': 'Adam Jonas'}, {'name': 'electric vehicles'}, {'name': 'EVs'}, {'name': 'mobility'}, {'name': 'Stories That Matter'}]}

After reaching 100.80 on Dec. 28, 2023—its lowest point in over 5 months—the U.S. dollar gained traction, with the index currently hovering near 103.32. This movement indicates that investors maintain confidence in the U.S. currency, despite fiscal challenges, at least in comparison to other currencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <strong>FedWatch Tool </strong>from <strong>CME Group</strong>, the probability of an interest rate reduction in March has decreased to 47% from 81% in the previous week. Moreover, investors are now expecting only 5 rate reductions throughout 2024, compared to the previous estimate of 6.

Singular maintained that versions 2 and 3 of the units, launched in 2017 and 2018 respectively, infringed on its patent rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google disputed these allegations, asserting that its technology is &#8220;fundamentally different than what is described in Singular&#8217;s patents.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terms of the settlement remain undisclosed.

The verdict is anticipated by January 31.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Trump is confronting a $370 million civil lawsuit in New York. The lawsuit accuses Trump, his sons <strong>Eric Trump</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong>, and other top executives of the <strong>Trump Organization</strong> of a decade-long scheme of fraud and misrepresentation to inflate Trump&#8217;s net worth for more favorable loan terms, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/trump-fraud-trial/?id=103642561">reported</a> ABC News.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s defense team has refuted all allegations, contending that the inflated valuations were a result of Trump&#8217;s business acumen. The trial follows a partial summary judgment that found Trump had submitted &#8220;fraudulent valuations&#8221; for his assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, New York Attorney General <strong>Letitia James</strong> cited a ruling involving <strong>Martin Shkreli,</strong> arguing for a lifetime real estate ban for Trump. Defense attorney <strong>Clifford Robert </strong>responded on Wednesday, calling the comparison &#8220;misplaced and irresponsible.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert argued that Trump&#8217;s fraud case lacks witnesses, complaints, and victims compared to Shkreli&#8217;s case. He also warned of the &#8220;sobering future consequences&#8221; of the Attorney General&#8217;s &#8220;shameless abuse of power.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump attorney <strong>Chris Kise</strong> reportedly said that the ruling in Trump&#8217;s case could have far-reaching implications for the New York business community.

Two years ago, Chen finished the same race five minutes faster while smoking along the way. He also garnered attention for chain-smoking during marathons in 2018 and 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report indicates authorities in <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/china">China</a> banned smoking during marathons two years ago, but it&#8217;s not clear if the initiative was in response to Chen&#8217;s actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reactions to the viral footage of the runner are wide-ranging. One X user called the accomplishment &#8220;downright insane,&#8221; several social media users praised the marathon runner as a &#8220;legend&#8221; and others complained that the smoke could negatively impact other runners and even be considered a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/04/31946859/is-cannabis-a-performance-enhancing-drug-the-science-is-in-and-the-answer-is-no">form</a><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/03/31269274/americans-prefer-legal-cannabis-over-tobacco-pew-survey-confirms-ongoing-trend-societal-shift"> of doping</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. government banned cigarette advertising in the &#8217;70s, so this is about as good as it gets for big tobacco.

The poll was conducted Jan. 19 through Jan. 21 and still included DeSantis as a candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s a look at who Republican voters selected in the Morning Consult poll, with the percentage <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/01/36652816/trumps-lead-among-republicans-hits-record-ahead-of-iowa-caucus-2024-election-poll-shows-where-ch">from last week</a> in parentheses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>: 75% (69%)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>: 12% (11%)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikki Haley</strong>: 12% (12%)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/01/36749394/trump-vice-president-pick-crypto-bettors-backing-haley-ramaswamy-desantis-and-this-potenti">Trump Vice President Pick: Crypto Bettors Backing Haley, Ramaswamy, DeSantis — And This Potential Frontrunner</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It\'s Important</strong>: Trump\'s lead jumps to 63 points, a new record since polling began in December 2022. Trump\'s 75% of the vote in the poll also marks a new full-week high since polling began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has been dominant in the poll of national Republican voters in recent weeks and the results in Iowa and New Hampshire shouldn\'t come as a huge surprise. Trump posted a lead of 50 points or more in multiple consecutive weeks in the national poll of Republican voters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis gained a percentage point before dropping out and was tied for second with Haley at 12% of the vote in the last poll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haley saw her support remain at 12% and she moved into a tie with DeSantis after previously topping him by one percentage point. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad news for Haley could be the poll\'s data pointing to Trump benefitting from DeSantis dropping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the voters who selected DeSantis as their top candidate, 57% selected Trump as their next pick. Thirty-five percent of voters who picked DeSantis listed Haley as their second choice and the rest picked someone else or were unsure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could suggest that Trump could add around 6% of DeSantis\'s 12% support with Haley adding 4%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new poll also found Trump had a favorable rating of 81% and an unfavorable rating of 18%. Both of these figures were an improvement from the prior week\'s totals of 77% and 21%, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis\'s favorable and unfavorable ratings were 63% and 23% respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haley had a favorable rating of 47% and an unfavorable rating of 32%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After her second-place finish in New Hampshire, Haley has vowed to stay in the Republican presidential race. February will see several more primaries, including Haley\'s <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/01/36519763/trump-leads-haley-by-29-points-in-her-home-state-could-that-be-the-primary-to-stop-her-momentum">home state of South Carolina</a> on Feb. 24, which could be a key state in her campaign to win the GOP nomination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read Next: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/01/36764834/donald-trumps-mix-up-of-nikki-haley-nancy-pelosi-sees-dementia-don-trend-on-social-media-2024-el">Donald Trump&#8217;s Mix-Up Of Nikki Haley, Nancy Pelosi Sees &#8216;Dementia Don&#8217; Trend On Social Media: 2024 Election Could Be Battle &#8216;Between Demented And Dementia&#8217;</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/01/36770478/trump-hits-record-lead-in-republican-2024-election-poll-how-desantis-exit-could-help-former-pres', 'image': [{'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/Republican-GOP-Election-Shutterstock_0.jpeg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/Republican-GOP-Election-Shutterstock_0.jpeg'}, {'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/Republican-GOP-Election-Shutterstock_0.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'Politics'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': '2024 election'}, {'name': '2024 Presidential Election'}, {'name': '2024 Presidential Race'}, {'name': 'Donald Trump'}, {'name': 'election poll'}, {'name': 'Morning Consult'}, {'name': 'Nikki Haley'}, {'name': 'Ron DeSantis'}, {'name': 'Vivek Ramaswamy'}]}

He highlighted the need for statewide regulations to avoid inconsistent local enforcement of cannabis laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Latanya Goodloe, emphasizing the racial and economic justice aspects, called for fair market regulations and recognition of the harm done in marginalized communities by the war on drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Public Sentiment And Legislative Resistance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite strong public support for medical marijuana legalization, as evidenced by various polls, legislative actions remain contradictory. A 2023 poll showed <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/10/35411183/nearly-70-of-kansans-support-cannabis-legalization-prioritize-pro-mmj-candidates">79% of Kansans in favor of medical marijuana</a> access through medical providers and 71% supporting decriminalization for personal use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a comprehensive medical marijuana bill has yet to reach the Kansas governor&rsquo;s desk. Sharon Brett from the ACLU of <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/kansas-cannabis">Kansas</a> criticized the legislature for intruding into personal healthcare decisions and ignoring public sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Political Context: Kansas GOP&#39;s Stance on Social Issues</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the growing movement for cannabis legalization, the Kansas Republican Party has proposed a conservative platform for 2024, opposing same-sex marriage, abortion&nbsp;and gun control measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislators have <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/12/36246217/kansas-senate-presidents-nod-to-medical-marijuana-is-one-of-americas-last-total-ban-states-turni">varied opinions</a> on these issues, with some emphasizing the importance of traditional values and others advocating for respect towards differing beliefs and the law of the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed GOP platform also covers education and healthcare policies. These stances indicate a potential reluctance to embrace <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/01/17/kansas-gops-proposed-platform-condemns-same-sex-marriage-abortion-gun-control/">progressive policies</a> like <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/cannabis">cannabis legalization</a>, despite public opinion trending in a more liberal direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. <strong>Vic Miller</strong><a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2024/01/17/ks-gop-proposed-platform-2024/"><strong> </strong>pointed out</a> that while the platform focuses on specific social issues, it may not directly influence legislation or address the more pressing concerns of Kansas residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: AI-Generated Image.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36766377/kansas-2024-a-defining-moment-for-medical-marijuana-in-a-holdout-state-is-change-imminent', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/01/24/dalle_2024-01-24_medical_patients_.jpg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/01/24/dalle_2024-01-24_medical_patients_.jpg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/01/24/dalle_2024-01-24_medical_patients_.jpg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'Cannabis'}, {'name': 'Government'}, {'name': 'News'}, {'name': 'Regulations'}, {'name': 'Legal'}, {'name': 'Markets'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': 'ACLU'}, {'name': 'GOP'}, {'name': 'Kansas cannabis'}]}

The outlook for subscriber growth had been more damaging, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>&nbsp;analyst Simon Flannery had an Overweight rating with a price target of $44.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst flagged Verizon&#8217;s significant beat on postpaid phone adds of 449k, with the outlook for positive consumer postpaid phone net adds in fiscal 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted that wireless service revenue was up year-on-year, with positive commentary on fiscal first-quarter pricing actions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst also pointed that broadband adds will likely continue above 400k per quarter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flannery flagged that expected deleveraging in fiscal 2024, driven by lower capex and a bit of EBITDA growth, may be met with increased shareholder returns in fiscal 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price action:&nbsp;</strong>VZ shares closed lower by<strong>&nbsp;</strong>2.25% at $41.28 on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Also Read:</em></strong><em>\xa0</em><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36747221/verizon-q4-shows-consumer-turnaround-continues-bofa-analyst-eyes-wireless-growth-in-2024-financial-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Verizon Q4 Shows Consumer Turnaround Continues &#8211; BofA Analyst Eyes Wireless Growth in 2024 Financial Forecast</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo by JeepersMedia on Flickr</em></p>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36770067/verizons-guidance-surprise-analysts-boost-forecast', 'image': [{'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/Verizon_4.jpeg'}, {'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/Verizon_4.jpeg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/Verizon_4.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'News'}, {'name': 'Price Target'}, {'name': 'Reiteration'}, {'name': 'Analyst Ratings'}, {'name': 'Trading Ideas'}], 'stocks': [{'name': 'T'}, {'name': 'TMUS'}, {'name': 'VZ'}], 'tags': [{'name': 'Briefs'}, {'name': 'Expert Ideas'}, {'name': 'Stories That Matter'}]}

The date for its first hearing has not been scheduled,\xa0<a href="https://www.keloland.com/keloland-com-original/sd-bill-seeks-to-ban-unregulated-cannabis-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>\xa0Keloland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new bill comes shortly after the\xa0<strong>South Dakota House of Representatives</strong> passed a bill\xa0<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36669075/guns-and-weed-south-dakota-house-passes-bill-forcing-cannabis-shops-to-warn-customers-of-fed-fir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forcing cannabis shops to warn customers of the federal firearms ban</a>.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>"It was in August 2022 — [someone] put an inquiry into the DEA about how we should handle these Delta-8, Delta-9, THC-O; these synthesized or chemically derived products from a hemp plant," Mulder said. "They essentially came out and said — that Delta-8 and Delta-9 THC-Os should be considered controlled substances."</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mudler added that he does not want to hinder the hemp industry and that the products he aims to ban are not naturally derived from hemp. The legislation modifies the current law by introducing the term "chemically derived cannabinoid."\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>"When we say chemically derived, we\'re saying that Delta-8, if you do your research, is really just found in trace amounts in the hemp plant along with Delta-10," Mulder said. "To get to where these products are now — they\'re changing the molecular makeup. This is not the product they say it is."</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mudler emphasized that these products are not tested and regulated like other cannabis products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>"The fact that we don\'t know what\'s in them, the FDA isn\'t even looking at them, they\'re consumable or inhaled products and the DEA\'s saying they\'re controlled substances — that\'s enough to say that\'s probably something we don\'t in an over-the-counter retail sale setting," Mulder concluded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Law Enforcement To Regain Authority</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, another marijuana-related bill passed the Senate Monday, enabling law enforcement and other state agencies to have more rights to search and impose disciplinary actions against medical marijuana facilities,\xa0<a href="https://kmit.com/news/236632-medical-marijuana-bill-allowing-law-enforcement-oversight-passes-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a>\xa0Kmit.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If SB71that is now heading to the House committee for review becomes law, the South Dakota Department of Health would no longer be the only authority on the regulation of medical marijuana dispensaries, cultivation, testing and production sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36697190/some-professions-may-lose-employment-protections-over-medical-marijuana-use-in-south-dakota-iowa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some Professions May Lose Employment Protections Over Medical Marijuana Use In South Dakota, Iowa Expands Offerings &amp; More Updates</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@elsaolofsson?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elsa Olofsson</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-couple-of-sticks-sitting-on-top-of-a-counter-3m9c72wkbIU?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36769061/gop-state-rep-in-south-dakota-pushes-ban-on-sale-of-delta-8-delta-10-and-other-unregulated-produ', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/elsa-olofsson-3m9c72wkbIU-unsplash.jpeg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/elsa-olofsson-3m9c72wkbIU-unsplash.jpeg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/elsa-olofsson-3m9c72wkbIU-unsplash.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'Cannabis'}, {'name': 'News'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': 'Brian Mulder'}, {'name': 'delta-10'}, {'name': 'Delta-8'}, {'name': 'HHC'}, {'name': 'South Dakota Cannabis'}, {'name': 'South Dakota medical marijuana'}, {'name': 'THC-O'}]}

They proved to be a once-popular way for companies to go public but often drew the attention of regulators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many companies that went public via SPAC trading have since delisted or gone bankrupt. Now, the SEC has decided to enact several new rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC, led by SEC Chairman <strong>Gary Gensler, </strong>voted 3-2 Wednesday on new rules. They&#8217;re expected to be enacted within five months, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/sec-wants-to-make-sure-spac-investors-know-what-theyre-getting-into-510aca30">to</a> the Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the new rule changes are more disclosures from the companies ahead of the offering and executives being held liable for the claims made. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concerns over dilution for SPAC mergers will be more present in filings. Disclosures and tables should show who owns shares and when they can sell them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big difference between SPACs and IPOs was often the forward guidance. SPAC presentations of deal announcements often included revenue and earnings estimates multiple years into the future. In many cases since, those estimates proved to be wildly inaccurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conflicts of interest between sponsors, affiliates and shareholders will also have to be disclosed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>"Whether you are doing a traditional IPO or a SPAC target IPO, SPAC investors are no less deserving of our time-tested investor presentations," Gensler said, according to a Reuters report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/23/03/31180908/chamath-palihapitiya-says-spacs-were-fueled-by-a-moment-in-time-of-just-enormous-liquidity-whats-nex">Chamath Palihapitiya Says SPACs Were &#8216;Fueled By A Moment In Time Of Just Enormous Liquidity&#8217;: What&#8217;s Next For Private Companies?</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It\'s Important:</strong> Over 800 SPACs raised $246 billion in 2020 and 2021, according to data from <a href="https://www.spacinsider.com/">SPACInsider </a>cited by the WSJ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the popular sectors that often saw SPAC mergers were sports betting, space, eVTOLs and e-commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rules to add disclosures and investor protections have been in the works for years. Wednesday\'s ruling could limit the number of companies that choose to go public via SPAC merger. \xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read Next: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/23/12/36289076/alex-rodriguez-goes-from-mlb-star-to-space-investor-with-new-spac-deal">Alex Rodriguez Goes From MLB Star To Space Investor With New SPAC Deal</a></em></p>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/24/01/36769005/sec-attacks-spacs-what-new-merger-rules-mean-for-investors-public-offerings', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/Securities-and-Exchange-Commission_0.jpeg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/Securities-and-Exchange-Commission_0.jpeg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/Securities-and-Exchange-Commission_0.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'M&A'}, {'name': 'IPOs'}, {'name': 'Top Stories'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': 'Gary Gensler'}, {'name': 'SEC'}, {'name': 'Securities and Exchange Commission'}, {'name': 'SPACs'}, {'name': 'Stories That Matter'}]}

It obtained the data through Trump\'s financial filings and disclosures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the ETH comes from royalties for non-fungible token (NFT) projects that Trump created. In December 2022, Trump released a set of 45,000 NFTs, each priced at $99. The project has amassed trading volumes of over $35 million or 15,000 ETH.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NFTs are largely trading above their original price of $99. As of Jan. 19, the cheapest NFT is listed for over $600 and the highest sale was for 37 ETH.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deloitte\'s fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart &amp; Target – </strong><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/mode-mobile-2"><strong>Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art — </strong><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/masterworks"><strong>this alternative asset has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%.

Some of the potential perks could be dinner with the former president, or even a small piece of fabric from the suit he wore in his Georgia mugshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Trump and his companies are not directly associated with these NFT projects. NFT International created and distributed the NFTs and uses Trump\'s "name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Digital LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms."</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump sold 1,075 ETH for over $2.4 million through Coinbase.. At its peak, it was worth more than $4 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sale comes after a strong month for Ethereum. The price was up more than 17% in the month leading up to the sale, 30% in the six months before and 60% over the past year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though Trump said during his presidency that he was "not a fan" of Bitcoin and that crypto is a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/09/22753280/former-us-president-donald-trump-crypto-is-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen">"disaster waiting to happen,"</a> it is hard to pass on several million dollars.

However, Green is barred from buying a gun because of his status as a medical marijuana patient.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ongoing Cases</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The current patchwork of rulings across the country highlights the growing tension between marijuana legalization efforts and federal gun laws. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/08/33719970/federal-court-strikes-down-gun-prohibition-for-cannabis-users-as-unconstitutional">dealt a major blow</a> to the ban in 2022, declaring it unconstitutional as applied to a man who used cannabis while possessing a gun. This put the Justice Department on the defensive, prompting multiple appeals and pushing the issue closer to the nation&#8217;s highest court.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Three cases pending before the Supreme Court could potentially settle the dispute once and for all. One involves a federal government appeal of the Fifth Circuit ruling, another centers on a similar case from Maryland and the third stems from a New York man&#8217;s challenge to the ban.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second Amendment At The Center Of The Battle</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of the legal battle lies the Second Amendment&#8217;s historical context. The plaintiffs argue that no historical precedent justifies disarming a person for using a substance legal in many states, while the Justice Department points to past restrictions on gun ownership for dangerous people such as the mentally ill and habitually drunk.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hunter Biden Thrown Into The Mix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the ongoing <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/12/36211739/hunter-biden-lawyers-argue-millions-in-legal-marijuana-states-violate-fed-gun-laws-raising-uncon">case against Hunter Biden</a>, accused of gun possession despite past drug use. This high-profile example has thrust the issue into the national spotlight, further amplifying calls for reform.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With legal battles escalating and public debate intensifying, the question of whether medical marijuana patients can exercise their Second Amendment rights seems poised for a showdown. Whether the Supreme Court will definitively decide the matter, or Congress steps in to address the conflict, the stakes keep getting higher for millions of Americans caught in the crossfire.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Read next:<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36727075/can-marijuana-use-cost-you-your-right-to-bear-arms-supreme-court-poised-to-weigh-on-cannabis-sec"> Can Marijuana Use Cost You Your Right To Bear Arms?

Since 2018, Elfenbein has been outperforming renowned investment figures such as <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31496603/warren-buffett-has-held-this-stock-for-over-34-years-why-he-will-never-sell">Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</a> and ARK Invest, thanks to his unique <a href="https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/news2/a-finance-blogger-has-outperformed-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-and-cathie-woods-ark-invest-since-2018-by-filling-his-etf-with-boring-stocks/986902/">"set and hold"</a> approach. This method involves creating a &#8220;buy list&#8221; of 25 stocks at the start of each year for his exchange-traded fund <strong>AdvisorShares Focused Equity ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CWS#NYSE">CWS</a>) and maintaining it unchanged for the entire year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elfenbein&#8217;s investment philosophy is grounded in discipline and long-term thinking. By not engaging in frequent trading, his strategy diverges from common practices in the investment world. The AdvisorShares ETF has achieved a return of 110% since its inception, significantly outshining the 74% and 45% returns of Berkshire Hathaway and ARK Innovation Fund, respectively. Typically, the fund&#8217;s holdings remain steady throughout the year, with occasional adjustments to a maximum of five stocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Elfenbein&#8217;s innovative &#8220;fulcrum fee&#8221; structure in the ETF aligns his interests with those of the investors, rewarding him for outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and benefiting investors if the fund underperforms. This model underscores Elfenbein&#8217;s view of investors as partners, sharing in both the successes and challenges of the fund. Such transparency and aligned incentives have positioned CWS as a pioneering fund in the ETF landscape\u200b\u200b.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 buy list includes companies with strong market positions and competitive advantages, such as The Hershey Co., Intuit Inc., Moody\'s Investors Service, HEICO Corp. and Silgan Holdings, with long-standing investments like Aflac Inc. Elfenbein focuses on long-term investments, with an average holding period of five years for each stock, highlighting his commitment to stability and growth over immediate returns. His buy list has achieved an 18-year compound gain of 573%, exceeding the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 447% return in the same timeframe\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elfenbein&#8217;s strategy offers a contrast to <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding">proprietary trading</a>, which is characterized by its dynamic, high-risk nature. Elfenbein&#8217;s set-and-hold strategy appeals to investors seeking steady, long-term growth, while proprietary trading attracts those looking for quicker, potentially higher returns despite the increased risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Jan. 10 interview on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4etnDEZFLGaQ091lJ5Kf9b">Downtown Josh Brown&#8217;s podcast</a> &#8220;The Compound and Friends,&#8221; Elfenbein eloquently summarized his investment approach: &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do a lot of trading. You don&#8217;t have to be in and out. You don&#8217;t have to get well-known growth stock names. You can get a sort of a boring portfolio, set and hold it and be disciplined and do very well.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This philosophy reflects his belief in the power of a disciplined, low-maintenance approach to achieve substantial market returns. Elfenbein encapsulated his method: &#8220;We&#8217;re as lazy as possible. That&#8217;s the goal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elfenbein&#8217;s success with the ETF, which is closing in on $100 million in assets under management, demonstrates the effectiveness of a disciplined, low-maintenance investment approach in the modern financial world. His method challenges traditional trading practices and offers an appealing alternative for investors seeking stable, long-term growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

Here are five valuable lessons learned from losing traders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Avoiding Undercapitalization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A common issue among losing traders is starting with insufficient capital, which limits their ability to absorb early losses. These traders often find themselves pressured to take high-risk trades to quickly recoup losses or generate significant profits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson here is the necessity of adequate capitalization. It provides a buffer against initial losses and allows traders to make decisions based on strategy rather than desperation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-capitalized trader has the resilience to withstand market fluctuations and stay in the game long enough to find success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Recognizing The Limitations Of Backtesting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often rely heavily on historical backtesting of their strategies without considering their limitations. While backtesting is a valuable tool, it sometimes gives a false sense of security as past performance is not always indicative of future results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine backtesting with forward-testing in real market conditions and remain cautious about over-optimizing strategies based on historical data alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Perils Of Overtrading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A frequent mistake of unsuccessful traders is overtrading — making too many trades in an attempt to recover from losses or capitalize on every perceived opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This often results in increased transaction costs and heightened exposure to risk. Focus on quality over quantity. Successful trading is about making well-considered and well-timed trades based on sound analysis, not about the frequency of trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Misjudging Market Correlation And Diversification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some losing traders misunderstand the concept of diversification, holding multiple assets that, unbeknownst to them, are highly correlated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turbulent market conditions, these correlated assets can all move in the same unfavorable direction, leading to significant losses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no replacement for understanding and managing market correlations. Effective diversification involves investing in assets with varying correlations to mitigate risk across different market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Ignoring The Psychological Aspect Of Losses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often overlook the psychological impact of their losses, leading to a detrimental cycle of doubt, fear and erratic decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must go into your career as a proper trader understanding the importance of psychological resilience and self-awareness. Acknowledging and learning from losses, rather than being demoralized by them, is a must.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing a mindset that views losses as an opportunity to learn and improve can be transformative for a trader&#8217;s approach and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember this: Every prop trader will make losing investments. It\'s part of the process. Your goal is to learn from your losses — and those of others — to maximize future gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

Toeing this line, but never crossing it, is essential to turning a profit over the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn a lot from successful prop traders, including the four lessons below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Risk Management Is Paramount</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful prop traders prioritize risk management above all else. They understand that preserving capital is as crucial as generating profits. This involves setting strict stop-loss limits, diversifying trades and not over-leveraging positions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By controlling the downside, they ensure that losses are manageable and do not cripple their trading capital. This approach is about playing the long game, recognizing that staying in the market is more important than short-term gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about how much they make on winning trades but how little they lose on the losing ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Adaptability To Market Conditions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Top prop traders excel in their ability to adapt to changing market conditions. They understand that strategies effective in one market environment may not work in another. These traders continuously analyze market trends, economic indicators and geopolitical events, adjusting their strategies accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility in trading styles — whether it&#8217;s shifting from short-term scalping to long-term trend following or from technical analysis to fundamental analysis — is a key differentiator. This adaptability prevents them from becoming overly committed to a single approach and allows them to capitalize on various market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Continuous Learning And Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial markets are constantly evolving and so must a prop trader&#8217;s skillset. Successful traders commit to lifelong learning, constantly updating their knowledge and refining their strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This involves staying abreast of the latest financial news, technological advancements in trading platforms and evolving market theories. It also includes learning from past trades, both successful and unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a process of continuous self-evaluation and education, these traders maintain a competitive edge and stay relevant in the ever-changing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Emotional Discipline And Patience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emotional control and patience are critical traits of successful prop traders. Maintaining composure under pressure and avoiding emotional decision-making distinguishes top traders from wannabees. They resist the urge to chase losses or become overconfident after a series of wins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This emotional discipline is coupled with patience and understanding that opportunities will present themselves, and not every market movement warrants a trade. These traders know that sometimes the best action is no action at all, and they wait for high-probability setups instead of succumbing to the temptation of overtrading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no such thing as guaranteed success in prop trading — or anything else in life. It\'s earned every day. When you follow this advice, it can tilt the investing scales in your favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

With an initial investment of $300, she set out to conquer the world of trading. &#8220;My first goal was to supplement that side hustle, so literally it&#8217;s like if I can just make five, six hundred a week and replace, you know, Lyft and Uber, then that&#8217;s already great for me,&#8221; Amores said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores set a clear goal: to earn weekly what she was previously earning bi-weekly at her job. By doing this, she said she was earning two to three months of salary in just one month. Within six months, she had saved a year&#8217;s salary, enabling her to leave her job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a single mother with family responsibilities, Amores emphasized the importance of cautious planning. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t just leave my job and hope for the best. I had to be prepared and ensure I had a safety net for my family,&#8221; she said, highlighting the balance she had to maintain between personal ambition and family responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the interview, Amores emphasized the importance of continuous learning and seeking mentorship. Her approach to trading is methodical, focusing on building a strong foundation before scaling up. She highlighted the critical role of risk management, saying, &#8220;Risk management only works if you&#8217;re following it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She stressed the importance of learning from verified sources. &#8220;The main thing I always say is to try to learn from a vetted person,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This means having some proof that they are who they say they are. It saves you time and headaches. You don&#8217;t want to attempt a master strategy, only to find that they&#8217;re teaching beginner-level material when you&#8217;re at an intermediate or advanced level.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amore&#8217;s journey is marked by her transition from trading small, personal accounts to managing large funds. This progression included experiences with percentage allocation management module (PAMM) accounts for forex and proprietary trading. Reflecting on her experiences, Amores said, &#8220;The thing about trading other people&#8217;s money taught me accountability.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking played a significant role in Amores\'s career. She acknowledged the power of building connections and being open to new opportunities. &#8220;You never know who you&#8217;re talking to,&#8221; she said, underscoring the potential of networking to open doors to larger trading opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores\'s trading strategy centers around liquidity, volume and high-probability setups. She approaches the market with a keen eye for where liquidity is and how it&#8217;s redistributed. &#8220;I&#8217;m always trading in line with liquidity,&#8221; she said, illustrating her tactical approach to trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The psychological aspects of trading are not lost on Amores. She discussed the importance of mindset, visualization and handling the pressures associated with trading large sums of money.

Jonas expects delivery growth to fall to 15% in 2024, less than half of the 38% growth it achieved in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the analyst continues to not bet against the company&#8217;s share price owing to the potential for an AI wildcard through the year and the capex guidance of at least $10 billion in FY24, higher than Morgan Stanley&#8217;s estimate of around $8.5 billion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the earnings call, company CEO<strong> Elon Musk</strong> suggested the possibility of an update on AI later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Change In Estimates:</strong> While retaining their price target, Jonas <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36771860/teslas-energy-segment-faces-q4-dip-as-automotive-grew-but-elon-musk-led-company-expects-trend-revers">decreased their Tesla revenue estimates</a> for FY24 to $106 billion on the back of lower expected auto revenue. However, the analyst now forecasts slightly higher automotive gross profit in the coming year of $13.3 billion and slightly higher operating margin with FY24 at 5.9% and FY25 at 8.3%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:\xa0</strong>Tesla shares closed down 0.6% at $207.83 on Wednesday and fell about 6% after hours, according to\xa0<a href="https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data from Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo via Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga\'s Future Of Mobility coverage by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mobility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following this link</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong></em> <em><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36771860/teslas-energy-segment-faces-q4-dip-as-automotive-grew-but-elon-musk-led-company-expects-trend-revers">Tesla&#8217;s Energy Segment Faces Q4 Dip As Automotive Grew, But Elon Musk-Led Company Expects Trend Reversal In 2024</a></em></p>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36771989/tesla-bull-adam-jonas-says-q4-conference-call-provided-no-information-to-disrupt-prevailing-sentimen', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/Tesla-stock_6.jpeg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/Tesla-stock_6.jpeg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/Tesla-stock_6.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'News'}, {'name': 'Top Stories'}, {'name': 'Analyst Ratings'}, {'name': 'Tech'}], 'stocks': [{'name': 'TSLA'}], 'tags': [{'name': 'Adam Jonas'}, {'name': 'electric vehicles'}, {'name': 'EVs'}, {'name': 'mobility'}, {'name': 'Stories That Matter'}]}

After reaching 100.80 on Dec. 28, 2023—its lowest point in over 5 months—the U.S. dollar gained traction, with the index currently hovering near 103.32. This movement indicates that investors maintain confidence in the U.S. currency, despite fiscal challenges, at least in comparison to other currencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <strong>FedWatch Tool </strong>from <strong>CME Group</strong>, the probability of an interest rate reduction in March has decreased to 47% from 81% in the previous week. Moreover, investors are now expecting only 5 rate reductions throughout 2024, compared to the previous estimate of 6. New York Fed President <strong>John Williams</strong> and Atlanta Fed President <strong>Raphael Bostic </strong>have communicated that they do not feel the need to hastily decrease interest rates, even if there are no further hikes under discussion, as per CNBC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Gainer (24 Hour)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-table"><table style="overflow:auto; height: 90px; display: block;"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong></td><td><strong>Gains +/-</strong></td><td><strong>Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Manta Network</strong> (CRYPTO: MANTA)</td><td>+23.01%</td><td>$3.20</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Helium </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/hnt/usd">HNT</a>)</td><td>+15.48%</td><td>$6.79</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pendle </strong>(CRYPTO: PENDLE)</td><td>+14.20%</td><td>$2.40</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.56 trillion, showing a 0.48% increase in the past 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Wednesday\'s session, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/01/36766217/stock-market-extends-record-highs-s-p-500-hits-4-900-on-tech-rally-microsofts-3-tri">concluded on a positive note.</a> The Nasdaq achieved a 0.4% increase, buoyed by the rally of technology stocks such as Netflix. Conversely, the Dow Jones exhibited weaker performance, ending the session approximately 0.3% lower.

Singular maintained that versions 2 and 3 of the units, launched in 2017 and 2018 respectively, infringed on its patent rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google disputed these allegations, asserting that its technology is &#8220;fundamentally different than what is described in Singular&#8217;s patents.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terms of the settlement remain undisclosed.

Deployments will be volatile and impacted by logistics and global distribution of products, said the company, while adding that it still expects continued growth on a twelve-month basis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla continues to ramp its Megafactory in Lathrop, California, towards full capacity.

This message is a direct warning to Trump&#8217;s intraparty opponents, indicating that they should not expect a return to normalcy or attempt to change the party from within.

"So if our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it,&#8221; said Fain, according to the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UAW had previously withheld its endorsement due to concerns about the administration&#8217;s push towards electric vehicles. However, the endorsement is a significant win for Biden, who has positioned himself as the &#8220;most pro-union president in American history&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden joined striking autoworkers on the picket line in Michigan last year, marking the first time a sitting president has done so. The endorsement comes as Biden&#8217;s reelection campaign shifts its focus to the general election following Trump&#8217;s win in the New Hampshire Republican primary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michigan, a state with a significant role in the U.S. auto industry, is expected to be a key battleground in the upcoming election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/01/36743035/donald-trump-sold-2-4-million-ethereum-smart-move-or-big-mistake?itm_source=parsely-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump Sold $2.4 Million Ethereum: Smart Move Or Big Mistake?</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The UAW&#8217;s endorsement of Biden comes after a period of uncertainty.

He\'s a counterpuncher,&#8221; said Tarlov, according to the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tarlov expressed concerns that Trump&#8217;s temperament could deter moderate voters, despite his recent victory in the New Hampshire GOP primary. She cited several election results as potential indicators for Trump to adjust his tone, but was skeptical about his capacity to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrasting Trump&#8217;s approach, Nikki Haley, who lost to Trump in the GOP primary, maintained an optimistic tone in her post-election speech, promising to continue her campaign. Trump, however, used his speech to attack Haley and pressure her to withdraw from the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tarlov stressed the importance of appealing to marginal voters in the general election, suggesting that Trump&#8217;s derogatory remarks could discourage potential supporters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/01/36707323/trump-against-cbdc-shiba-inus-whale-transaction-volume-soars-dogecoin-predicted-to-hit-5-m?itm_source=parsely-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump Against CBDC, Shiba Inu&#8217;s Whale Transaction Volume Soars, Dogecoin Predicted To Hit $5 Mark And More: This Week In Crypto</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Trump&#8217;s aggressive demeanor has been a topic of discussion in the past.

The verdict is anticipated by January 31.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Trump is confronting a $370 million civil lawsuit in New York. The lawsuit accuses Trump, his sons <strong>Eric Trump</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong>, and other top executives of the <strong>Trump Organization</strong> of a decade-long scheme of fraud and misrepresentation to inflate Trump&#8217;s net worth for more favorable loan terms, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/trump-fraud-trial/?id=103642561">reported</a> ABC News.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s defense team has refuted all allegations, contending that the inflated valuations were a result of Trump&#8217;s business acumen. The trial follows a partial summary judgment that found Trump had submitted &#8220;fraudulent valuations&#8221; for his assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, New York Attorney General <strong>Letitia James</strong> cited a ruling involving <strong>Martin Shkreli,</strong> arguing for a lifetime real estate ban for Trump. Defense attorney <strong>Clifford Robert </strong>responded on Wednesday, calling the comparison &#8220;misplaced and irresponsible.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert argued that Trump&#8217;s fraud case lacks witnesses, complaints, and victims compared to Shkreli&#8217;s case. He also warned of the &#8220;sobering future consequences&#8221; of the Attorney General&#8217;s &#8220;shameless abuse of power.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump attorney <strong>Chris Kise</strong> reportedly said that the ruling in Trump&#8217;s case could have far-reaching implications for the New York business community. He urged major bank CEOs and Wall Street participants to speak out against the Attorney General&#8217;s &#8220;shocking and tyrannical interference in the capital markets.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36710420/paul-krugman-blames-ron-desantiss-anti-vax-crusade-for-thousands-of-deaths-musk-reacts-you-give-econ?itm_source=parsely-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Krugman Blames Ron Desantis&#8217;s Anti-Vax Crusade For Thousands Of Deaths, Musk Reacts: &#8216;You Give Economics A Bad Name&#8217;</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The comparison to Shkreli, who was recently <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/24/01/36754161/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-cannot-return-to-drug-industry-ever-court-upholds-lifetime-ban">banned for life</a> from the pharmaceutical industry, is significant. Shkreli, known for his &#8220;particularly heartless and coercive&#8221; tactics in monopolizing the antiparasitic drug <strong>Daraprim</strong>, served more than four years of his seven-year sentence for fraud before being released to a halfway house in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s case has been contentious, with the former President <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36600824/trump-erupts-in-court-proclaiming-innocence-in-new-york-fraud-trial">proclaiming his innocence</a> in court and invoking his Fifth Amendment rights during a deposition by New York Attorney General lawyers.

Two years ago, Chen finished the same race five minutes faster while smoking along the way. He also garnered attention for chain-smoking during marathons in 2018 and 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report indicates authorities in <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/china">China</a> banned smoking during marathons two years ago, but it&#8217;s not clear if the initiative was in response to Chen&#8217;s actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reactions to the viral footage of the runner are wide-ranging. One X user called the accomplishment &#8220;downright insane,&#8221; several social media users praised the marathon runner as a &#8220;legend&#8221; and others complained that the smoke could negatively impact other runners and even be considered a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/04/31946859/is-cannabis-a-performance-enhancing-drug-the-science-is-in-and-the-answer-is-no">form</a><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/03/31269274/americans-prefer-legal-cannabis-over-tobacco-pew-survey-confirms-ongoing-trend-societal-shift"> of doping</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. government banned cigarette advertising in the &#8217;70s, so this is about as good as it gets for big tobacco.

The poll was conducted Jan. 19 through Jan. 21 and still included DeSantis as a candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s a look at who Republican voters selected in the Morning Consult poll, with the percentage <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/01/36652816/trumps-lead-among-republicans-hits-record-ahead-of-iowa-caucus-2024-election-poll-shows-where-ch">from last week</a> in parentheses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>: 75% (69%)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>: 12% (11%)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikki Haley</strong>: 12% (12%)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/01/36749394/trump-vice-president-pick-crypto-bettors-backing-haley-ramaswamy-desantis-and-this-potenti">Trump Vice President Pick: Crypto Bettors Backing Haley, Ramaswamy, DeSantis — And This Potential Frontrunner</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It\'s Important</strong>: Trump\'s lead jumps to 63 points, a new record since polling began in December 2022. Trump\'s 75% of the vote in the poll also marks a new full-week high since polling began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has been dominant in the poll of national Republican voters in recent weeks and the results in Iowa and New Hampshire shouldn\'t come as a huge surprise. Trump posted a lead of 50 points or more in multiple consecutive weeks in the national poll of Republican voters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis gained a percentage point before dropping out and was tied for second with Haley at 12% of the vote in the last poll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haley saw her support remain at 12% and she moved into a tie with DeSantis after previously topping him by one percentage point. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad news for Haley could be the poll\'s data pointing to Trump benefitting from DeSantis dropping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the voters who selected DeSantis as their top candidate, 57% selected Trump as their next pick. Thirty-five percent of voters who picked DeSantis listed Haley as their second choice and the rest picked someone else or were unsure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could suggest that Trump could add around 6% of DeSantis\'s 12% support with Haley adding 4%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new poll also found Trump had a favorable rating of 81% and an unfavorable rating of 18%. Both of these figures were an improvement from the prior week\'s totals of 77% and 21%, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis\'s favorable and unfavorable ratings were 63% and 23% respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haley had a favorable rating of 47% and an unfavorable rating of 32%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After her second-place finish in New Hampshire, Haley has vowed to stay in the Republican presidential race.

He highlighted the need for statewide regulations to avoid inconsistent local enforcement of cannabis laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Latanya Goodloe, emphasizing the racial and economic justice aspects, called for fair market regulations and recognition of the harm done in marginalized communities by the war on drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Public Sentiment And Legislative Resistance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite strong public support for medical marijuana legalization, as evidenced by various polls, legislative actions remain contradictory. A 2023 poll showed <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/10/35411183/nearly-70-of-kansans-support-cannabis-legalization-prioritize-pro-mmj-candidates">79% of Kansans in favor of medical marijuana</a> access through medical providers and 71% supporting decriminalization for personal use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a comprehensive medical marijuana bill has yet to reach the Kansas governor&rsquo;s desk. Sharon Brett from the ACLU of <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/kansas-cannabis">Kansas</a> criticized the legislature for intruding into personal healthcare decisions and ignoring public sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Political Context: Kansas GOP&#39;s Stance on Social Issues</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the growing movement for cannabis legalization, the Kansas Republican Party has proposed a conservative platform for 2024, opposing same-sex marriage, abortion&nbsp;and gun control measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislators have <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/12/36246217/kansas-senate-presidents-nod-to-medical-marijuana-is-one-of-americas-last-total-ban-states-turni">varied opinions</a> on these issues, with some emphasizing the importance of traditional values and others advocating for respect towards differing beliefs and the law of the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed GOP platform also covers education and healthcare policies. These stances indicate a potential reluctance to embrace <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/01/17/kansas-gops-proposed-platform-condemns-same-sex-marriage-abortion-gun-control/">progressive policies</a> like <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/cannabis">cannabis legalization</a>, despite public opinion trending in a more liberal direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. <strong>Vic Miller</strong><a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2024/01/17/ks-gop-proposed-platform-2024/"><strong> </strong>pointed out</a> that while the platform focuses on specific social issues, it may not directly influence legislation or address the more pressing concerns of Kansas residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: AI-Generated Image.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36766377/kansas-2024-a-defining-moment-for-medical-marijuana-in-a-holdout-state-is-change-imminent', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/01/24/dalle_2024-01-24_medical_patients_.jpg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/01/24/dalle_2024-01-24_medical_patients_.jpg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/01/24/dalle_2024-01-24_medical_patients_.jpg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'Cannabis'}, {'name': 'Government'}, {'name': 'News'}, {'name': 'Regulations'}, {'name': 'Legal'}, {'name': 'Markets'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': 'ACLU'}, {'name': 'GOP'}, {'name': 'Kansas cannabis'}]}

Normalizing CapEx is a ~$1.5 billion FCF tailwind but could be offset by higher device upgrades and cash taxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, he noted Verizon was better positioned than two years ago and considered the results positive for&nbsp;<strong>AT&amp;T Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/T#NYSE">T</a>), neutral to&nbsp;<strong>T-Mobile US, Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TMUS#NASDAQ">TMUS</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Raymond James</strong>&nbsp;analyst Frank G.

They proved to be a once-popular way for companies to go public but often drew the attention of regulators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many companies that went public via SPAC trading have since delisted or gone bankrupt. Now, the SEC has decided to enact several new rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC, led by SEC Chairman <strong>Gary Gensler, </strong>voted 3-2 Wednesday on new rules. They&#8217;re expected to be enacted within five months, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/sec-wants-to-make-sure-spac-investors-know-what-theyre-getting-into-510aca30">to</a> the Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the new rule changes are more disclosures from the companies ahead of the offering and executives being held liable for the claims made. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concerns over dilution for SPAC mergers will be more present in filings. Disclosures and tables should show who owns shares and when they can sell them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big difference between SPACs and IPOs was often the forward guidance. SPAC presentations of deal announcements often included revenue and earnings estimates multiple years into the future. In many cases since, those estimates proved to be wildly inaccurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conflicts of interest between sponsors, affiliates and shareholders will also have to be disclosed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>"Whether you are doing a traditional IPO or a SPAC target IPO, SPAC investors are no less deserving of our time-tested investor presentations," Gensler said, according to a Reuters report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/23/03/31180908/chamath-palihapitiya-says-spacs-were-fueled-by-a-moment-in-time-of-just-enormous-liquidity-whats-nex">Chamath Palihapitiya Says SPACs Were &#8216;Fueled By A Moment In Time Of Just Enormous Liquidity&#8217;: What&#8217;s Next For Private Companies?</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It\'s Important:</strong> Over 800 SPACs raised $246 billion in 2020 and 2021, according to data from <a href="https://www.spacinsider.com/">SPACInsider </a>cited by the WSJ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the popular sectors that often saw SPAC mergers were sports betting, space, eVTOLs and e-commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rules to add disclosures and investor protections have been in the works for years. Wednesday\'s ruling could limit the number of companies that choose to go public via SPAC merger. \xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read Next: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/23/12/36289076/alex-rodriguez-goes-from-mlb-star-to-space-investor-with-new-spac-deal">Alex Rodriguez Goes From MLB Star To Space Investor With New SPAC Deal</a></em></p>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/24/01/36769005/sec-attacks-spacs-what-new-merger-rules-mean-for-investors-public-offerings', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/Securities-and-Exchange-Commission_0.jpeg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/Securities-and-Exchange-Commission_0.jpeg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/Securities-and-Exchange-Commission_0.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'M&A'}, {'name': 'IPOs'}, {'name': 'Top Stories'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': 'Gary Gensler'}, {'name': 'SEC'}, {'name': 'Securities and Exchange Commission'}, {'name': 'SPACs'}, {'name': 'Stories That Matter'}]}

However, Green is barred from buying a gun because of his status as a medical marijuana patient.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ongoing Cases</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The current patchwork of rulings across the country highlights the growing tension between marijuana legalization efforts and federal gun laws. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/08/33719970/federal-court-strikes-down-gun-prohibition-for-cannabis-users-as-unconstitutional">dealt a major blow</a> to the ban in 2022, declaring it unconstitutional as applied to a man who used cannabis while possessing a gun. This put the Justice Department on the defensive, prompting multiple appeals and pushing the issue closer to the nation&#8217;s highest court.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Three cases pending before the Supreme Court could potentially settle the dispute once and for all. One involves a federal government appeal of the Fifth Circuit ruling, another centers on a similar case from Maryland and the third stems from a New York man&#8217;s challenge to the ban.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second Amendment At The Center Of The Battle</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of the legal battle lies the Second Amendment&#8217;s historical context. The plaintiffs argue that no historical precedent justifies disarming a person for using a substance legal in many states, while the Justice Department points to past restrictions on gun ownership for dangerous people such as the mentally ill and habitually drunk.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hunter Biden Thrown Into The Mix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the ongoing <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/12/36211739/hunter-biden-lawyers-argue-millions-in-legal-marijuana-states-violate-fed-gun-laws-raising-uncon">case against Hunter Biden</a>, accused of gun possession despite past drug use. This high-profile example has thrust the issue into the national spotlight, further amplifying calls for reform.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With legal battles escalating and public debate intensifying, the question of whether medical marijuana patients can exercise their Second Amendment rights seems poised for a showdown. Whether the Supreme Court will definitively decide the matter, or Congress steps in to address the conflict, the stakes keep getting higher for millions of Americans caught in the crossfire.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Read next:<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36727075/can-marijuana-use-cost-you-your-right-to-bear-arms-supreme-court-poised-to-weigh-on-cannabis-sec"> Can Marijuana Use Cost You Your Right To Bear Arms?

Here are five valuable lessons learned from losing traders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Avoiding Undercapitalization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A common issue among losing traders is starting with insufficient capital, which limits their ability to absorb early losses. These traders often find themselves pressured to take high-risk trades to quickly recoup losses or generate significant profits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson here is the necessity of adequate capitalization. It provides a buffer against initial losses and allows traders to make decisions based on strategy rather than desperation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-capitalized trader has the resilience to withstand market fluctuations and stay in the game long enough to find success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Recognizing The Limitations Of Backtesting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often rely heavily on historical backtesting of their strategies without considering their limitations. While backtesting is a valuable tool, it sometimes gives a false sense of security as past performance is not always indicative of future results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine backtesting with forward-testing in real market conditions and remain cautious about over-optimizing strategies based on historical data alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Perils Of Overtrading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A frequent mistake of unsuccessful traders is overtrading — making too many trades in an attempt to recover from losses or capitalize on every perceived opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This often results in increased transaction costs and heightened exposure to risk. Focus on quality over quantity. Successful trading is about making well-considered and well-timed trades based on sound analysis, not about the frequency of trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Misjudging Market Correlation And Diversification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some losing traders misunderstand the concept of diversification, holding multiple assets that, unbeknownst to them, are highly correlated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turbulent market conditions, these correlated assets can all move in the same unfavorable direction, leading to significant losses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no replacement for understanding and managing market correlations. Effective diversification involves investing in assets with varying correlations to mitigate risk across different market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Ignoring The Psychological Aspect Of Losses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often overlook the psychological impact of their losses, leading to a detrimental cycle of doubt, fear and erratic decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must go into your career as a proper trader understanding the importance of psychological resilience and self-awareness. Acknowledging and learning from losses, rather than being demoralized by them, is a must.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing a mindset that views losses as an opportunity to learn and improve can be transformative for a trader&#8217;s approach and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember this: Every prop trader will make losing investments. It\'s part of the process. Your goal is to learn from your losses — and those of others — to maximize future gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

Toeing this line, but never crossing it, is essential to turning a profit over the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn a lot from successful prop traders, including the four lessons below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Risk Management Is Paramount</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful prop traders prioritize risk management above all else. They understand that preserving capital is as crucial as generating profits. This involves setting strict stop-loss limits, diversifying trades and not over-leveraging positions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By controlling the downside, they ensure that losses are manageable and do not cripple their trading capital. This approach is about playing the long game, recognizing that staying in the market is more important than short-term gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about how much they make on winning trades but how little they lose on the losing ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Adaptability To Market Conditions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Top prop traders excel in their ability to adapt to changing market conditions. They understand that strategies effective in one market environment may not work in another. These traders continuously analyze market trends, economic indicators and geopolitical events, adjusting their strategies accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility in trading styles — whether it&#8217;s shifting from short-term scalping to long-term trend following or from technical analysis to fundamental analysis — is a key differentiator. This adaptability prevents them from becoming overly committed to a single approach and allows them to capitalize on various market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Continuous Learning And Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial markets are constantly evolving and so must a prop trader&#8217;s skillset. Successful traders commit to lifelong learning, constantly updating their knowledge and refining their strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This involves staying abreast of the latest financial news, technological advancements in trading platforms and evolving market theories. It also includes learning from past trades, both successful and unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a process of continuous self-evaluation and education, these traders maintain a competitive edge and stay relevant in the ever-changing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Emotional Discipline And Patience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emotional control and patience are critical traits of successful prop traders. Maintaining composure under pressure and avoiding emotional decision-making distinguishes top traders from wannabees. They resist the urge to chase losses or become overconfident after a series of wins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This emotional discipline is coupled with patience and understanding that opportunities will present themselves, and not every market movement warrants a trade. These traders know that sometimes the best action is no action at all, and they wait for high-probability setups instead of succumbing to the temptation of overtrading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no such thing as guaranteed success in prop trading — or anything else in life. It\'s earned every day. When you follow this advice, it can tilt the investing scales in your favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

With an initial investment of $300, she set out to conquer the world of trading. &#8220;My first goal was to supplement that side hustle, so literally it&#8217;s like if I can just make five, six hundred a week and replace, you know, Lyft and Uber, then that&#8217;s already great for me,&#8221; Amores said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores set a clear goal: to earn weekly what she was previously earning bi-weekly at her job. By doing this, she said she was earning two to three months of salary in just one month. Within six months, she had saved a year&#8217;s salary, enabling her to leave her job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a single mother with family responsibilities, Amores emphasized the importance of cautious planning. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t just leave my job and hope for the best. I had to be prepared and ensure I had a safety net for my family,&#8221; she said, highlighting the balance she had to maintain between personal ambition and family responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the interview, Amores emphasized the importance of continuous learning and seeking mentorship. Her approach to trading is methodical, focusing on building a strong foundation before scaling up. She highlighted the critical role of risk management, saying, &#8220;Risk management only works if you&#8217;re following it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She stressed the importance of learning from verified sources. &#8220;The main thing I always say is to try to learn from a vetted person,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This means having some proof that they are who they say they are. It saves you time and headaches. You don&#8217;t want to attempt a master strategy, only to find that they&#8217;re teaching beginner-level material when you&#8217;re at an intermediate or advanced level.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amore&#8217;s journey is marked by her transition from trading small, personal accounts to managing large funds. This progression included experiences with percentage allocation management module (PAMM) accounts for forex and proprietary trading. Reflecting on her experiences, Amores said, &#8220;The thing about trading other people&#8217;s money taught me accountability.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking played a significant role in Amores\'s career. She acknowledged the power of building connections and being open to new opportunities. &#8220;You never know who you&#8217;re talking to,&#8221; she said, underscoring the potential of networking to open doors to larger trading opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores\'s trading strategy centers around liquidity, volume and high-probability setups. She approaches the market with a keen eye for where liquidity is and how it&#8217;s redistributed. &#8220;I&#8217;m always trading in line with liquidity,&#8221; she said, illustrating her tactical approach to trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The psychological aspects of trading are not lost on Amores. She discussed the importance of mindset, visualization and handling the pressures associated with trading large sums of money. Amores has learned to manage these challenges gracefully, contributing to her overall success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores has set ambitious goals for herself, including trading multimillion-dollar accounts and eventually reaching billion-dollar allocations. Her story is not just about financial success; it&#8217;s about overcoming challenges and pursuing one&#8217;s goals, making her an inspiration to aspiring traders worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

She emphasized that the Republican Party is undergoing a significant transformation, with unwavering support for Trump and his policies.

This statement sends a clear message to dissenting Republicans: their views are not welcome within the party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greene acknowledged the presence of Trump skeptics within the party but made it clear that they will not only lose but will also be purged from GOP politics. This message is a direct warning to Trump&#8217;s intraparty opponents, indicating that they should not expect a return to normalcy or attempt to change the party from within. Instead, they should prepare to be &#8220;eradicated.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/01/36710651/pastor-said-god-told-him-to-remodel-home-after-selling-1-3m-worth-of-worthless-crypto-to-f?itm_source=parsely-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pastor Said God Told Him To Remodel Home After Selling $1.3M Worth Of &#8216;Worthless Crypto&#8217; To Followers</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Greene&#8217;s statement comes at a crucial time for the Republican Party, with Trump&#8217;s influence on the rise.

Trump\'s 75% of the vote in the poll also marks a new full-week high since polling began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has been dominant in the poll of national Republican voters in recent weeks and the results in Iowa and New Hampshire shouldn\'t come as a huge surprise. Trump posted a lead of 50 points or more in multiple consecutive weeks in the national poll of Republican voters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis gained a percentage point before dropping out and was tied for second with Haley at 12% of the vote in the last poll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haley saw her support remain at 12% and she moved into a tie with DeSantis after previously topping him by one percentage point. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad news for Haley could be the poll\'s data pointing to Trump benefitting from DeSantis dropping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the voters who selected DeSantis as their top candidate, 57% selected Trump as their next pick. Thirty-five percent of voters who picked DeSantis listed Haley as their second choice and the rest picked someone else or were unsure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could suggest that Trump could add around 6% of DeSantis\'s 12% support with Haley adding 4%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new poll also found Trump had a favorable rating of 81% and an unfavorable rating of 18%. Both of these figures were an improvement from the prior week\'s totals of 77% and 21%, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis\'s favorable and unfavorable ratings were 63% and 23% respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haley had a favorable rating of 47% and an unfavorable rating of 32%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After her second-place finish in New Hampshire, Haley has vowed to stay in the Republican presidential race.

He highlighted the need for statewide regulations to avoid inconsistent local enforcement of cannabis laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Latanya Goodloe, emphasizing the racial and economic justice aspects, called for fair market regulations and recognition of the harm done in marginalized communities by the war on drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Public Sentiment And Legislative Resistance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite strong public support for medical marijuana legalization, as evidenced by various polls, legislative actions remain contradictory.

These stances indicate a potential reluctance to embrace <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/01/17/kansas-gops-proposed-platform-condemns-same-sex-marriage-abortion-gun-control/">progressive policies</a> like <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/cannabis">cannabis legalization</a>, despite public opinion trending in a more liberal direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. <strong>Vic Miller</strong><a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2024/01/17/ks-gop-proposed-platform-2024/"><strong> </strong>pointed out</a> that while the platform focuses on specific social issues, it may not directly influence legislation or address the more pressing concerns of Kansas residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: AI-Generated Image.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36766377/kansas-2024-a-defining-moment-for-medical-marijuana-in-a-holdout-state-is-change-imminent', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/01/24/dalle_2024-01-24_medical_patients_.jpg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/01/24/dalle_2024-01-24_medical_patients_.jpg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/01/24/dalle_2024-01-24_medical_patients_.jpg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'Cannabis'}, {'name': 'Government'}, {'name': 'News'}, {'name': 'Regulations'}, {'name': 'Legal'}, {'name': 'Markets'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': 'ACLU'}, {'name': 'GOP'}, {'name': 'Kansas cannabis'}]}

Or, as MMA\'s chair Peter Hunt AM said, "the beginning of a major shift in our mental healthcare system."</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Benzinga edit with photo by New Africa, GillianVann and Arif_Vector on Shutterstock.</em></p>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/24/01/36770123/australian-psychiatrists-provide-first-psychedelic-assisted-medical-treatments-in-50-years', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/psychedelic-Asia-Australia-New-Zealand-N.jpeg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/psychedelic-Asia-Australia-New-Zealand-N.jpeg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/psychedelic-Asia-Australia-New-Zealand-N.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'Biotech'}, {'name': 'Cannabis'}, {'name': 'Psychedelics'}, {'name': 'Health Care'}, {'name': 'Global'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': 'Australia Psychedelics'}, {'name': 'Mind Medicine Australia'}, {'name': 'Psychedelic-Assisted Therapies'}]}

They proved to be a once-popular way for companies to go public but often drew the attention of regulators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many companies that went public via SPAC trading have since delisted or gone bankrupt.

However, Green is barred from buying a gun because of his status as a medical marijuana patient.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ongoing Cases</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The current patchwork of rulings across the country highlights the growing tension between marijuana legalization efforts and federal gun laws. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/08/33719970/federal-court-strikes-down-gun-prohibition-for-cannabis-users-as-unconstitutional">dealt a major blow</a> to the ban in 2022, declaring it unconstitutional as applied to a man who used cannabis while possessing a gun. This put the Justice Department on the defensive, prompting multiple appeals and pushing the issue closer to the nation&#8217;s highest court.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Three cases pending before the Supreme Court could potentially settle the dispute once and for all. One involves a federal government appeal of the Fifth Circuit ruling, another centers on a similar case from Maryland and the third stems from a New York man&#8217;s challenge to the ban.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second Amendment At The Center Of The Battle</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of the legal battle lies the Second Amendment&#8217;s historical context. The plaintiffs argue that no historical precedent justifies disarming a person for using a substance legal in many states, while the Justice Department points to past restrictions on gun ownership for dangerous people such as the mentally ill and habitually drunk.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hunter Biden Thrown Into The Mix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the ongoing <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/12/36211739/hunter-biden-lawyers-argue-millions-in-legal-marijuana-states-violate-fed-gun-laws-raising-uncon">case against Hunter Biden</a>, accused of gun possession despite past drug use. This high-profile example has thrust the issue into the national spotlight, further amplifying calls for reform.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With legal battles escalating and public debate intensifying, the question of whether medical marijuana patients can exercise their Second Amendment rights seems poised for a showdown.

The compound, known as Koolau Ranch, is set to include a 5,000-square-foot underground bunker, complete with its own energy and food supplies. The bunker&#8217;s design incorporates a metal door filled with concrete, a feature commonly found in bunkers and bomb shelters.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The project, which reflects a growing trend among Silicon Valley elites for preparedness and luxury, is estimated to cost around $100 million to build on top of the $170 million spent acquiring the land. This brings the total investment to approximately $270 million, according to Wired.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Here is where</strong><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/ourcrowd"><strong> </strong><strong>your most successful angel investment</strong></a><strong> may be hidden.</strong></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>How to achieve your boldest financial goals in 2024?</strong><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/vyzer"><strong> </strong><strong>These investors have the latest tips</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The project has been shrouded in secrecy since the beginning. Workers on the ranch are required to sign strict nondisclosure agreements, and reports indicate people have been fired for posting on social media that they are working on the project. Workers on the compound undergo constant surveillance from hundreds of cameras, and military-style security measures have been implemented across the ranch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The methods to acquire the land also give rise to issues and speculation. Zuckerberg initially hid the purchases of land using shell companies and brokers to disguise them. Those shell companies are now involved in several lawsuits claiming they pressured locals with ancestral land rights to sell the land or get into a bidding war at auction with one of the richest men in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The sprawling 1,400-acre compound is planned to house more than just the bunker. It will include over 30 bedrooms and bathrooms, two mansions connected by a tunnel to the bunker and nearly a dozen tree houses linked by rope bridges.

Here are five valuable lessons learned from losing traders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Avoiding Undercapitalization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A common issue among losing traders is starting with insufficient capital, which limits their ability to absorb early losses. These traders often find themselves pressured to take high-risk trades to quickly recoup losses or generate significant profits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson here is the necessity of adequate capitalization. It provides a buffer against initial losses and allows traders to make decisions based on strategy rather than desperation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-capitalized trader has the resilience to withstand market fluctuations and stay in the game long enough to find success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Recognizing The Limitations Of Backtesting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often rely heavily on historical backtesting of their strategies without considering their limitations. While backtesting is a valuable tool, it sometimes gives a false sense of security as past performance is not always indicative of future results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine backtesting with forward-testing in real market conditions and remain cautious about over-optimizing strategies based on historical data alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Perils Of Overtrading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A frequent mistake of unsuccessful traders is overtrading — making too many trades in an attempt to recover from losses or capitalize on every perceived opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This often results in increased transaction costs and heightened exposure to risk. Focus on quality over quantity. Successful trading is about making well-considered and well-timed trades based on sound analysis, not about the frequency of trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Misjudging Market Correlation And Diversification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some losing traders misunderstand the concept of diversification, holding multiple assets that, unbeknownst to them, are highly correlated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turbulent market conditions, these correlated assets can all move in the same unfavorable direction, leading to significant losses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no replacement for understanding and managing market correlations. Effective diversification involves investing in assets with varying correlations to mitigate risk across different market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Ignoring The Psychological Aspect Of Losses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing traders often overlook the psychological impact of their losses, leading to a detrimental cycle of doubt, fear and erratic decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must go into your career as a proper trader understanding the importance of psychological resilience and self-awareness. Acknowledging and learning from losses, rather than being demoralized by them, is a must.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing a mindset that views losses as an opportunity to learn and improve can be transformative for a trader&#8217;s approach and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember this: Every prop trader will make losing investments. It\'s part of the process. Your goal is to learn from your losses — and those of others — to maximize future gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

Toeing this line, but never crossing it, is essential to turning a profit over the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn a lot from successful prop traders, including the four lessons below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Risk Management Is Paramount</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful prop traders prioritize risk management above all else. They understand that preserving capital is as crucial as generating profits. This involves setting strict stop-loss limits, diversifying trades and not over-leveraging positions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By controlling the downside, they ensure that losses are manageable and do not cripple their trading capital. This approach is about playing the long game, recognizing that staying in the market is more important than short-term gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about how much they make on winning trades but how little they lose on the losing ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Adaptability To Market Conditions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Top prop traders excel in their ability to adapt to changing market conditions. They understand that strategies effective in one market environment may not work in another. These traders continuously analyze market trends, economic indicators and geopolitical events, adjusting their strategies accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility in trading styles — whether it&#8217;s shifting from short-term scalping to long-term trend following or from technical analysis to fundamental analysis — is a key differentiator. This adaptability prevents them from becoming overly committed to a single approach and allows them to capitalize on various market scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Continuous Learning And Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial markets are constantly evolving and so must a prop trader&#8217;s skillset. Successful traders commit to lifelong learning, constantly updating their knowledge and refining their strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This involves staying abreast of the latest financial news, technological advancements in trading platforms and evolving market theories. It also includes learning from past trades, both successful and unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a process of continuous self-evaluation and education, these traders maintain a competitive edge and stay relevant in the ever-changing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Emotional Discipline And Patience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emotional control and patience are critical traits of successful prop traders. Maintaining composure under pressure and avoiding emotional decision-making distinguishes top traders from wannabees. They resist the urge to chase losses or become overconfident after a series of wins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This emotional discipline is coupled with patience and understanding that opportunities will present themselves, and not every market movement warrants a trade. These traders know that sometimes the best action is no action at all, and they wait for high-probability setups instead of succumbing to the temptation of overtrading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no such thing as guaranteed success in prop trading — or anything else in life. It\'s earned every day. When you follow this advice, it can tilt the investing scales in your favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

With an initial investment of $300, she set out to conquer the world of trading. &#8220;My first goal was to supplement that side hustle, so literally it&#8217;s like if I can just make five, six hundred a week and replace, you know, Lyft and Uber, then that&#8217;s already great for me,&#8221; Amores said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t Miss:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Webull and Robinhood may have revolutionized stock market investing, but<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> this prop trading firm is reshaping the game for profitable traders</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimal rules, uncapped earnings\' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/apex-trader-funding"> Learn how you can get in on the action.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores set a clear goal: to earn weekly what she was previously earning bi-weekly at her job. By doing this, she said she was earning two to three months of salary in just one month. Within six months, she had saved a year&#8217;s salary, enabling her to leave her job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a single mother with family responsibilities, Amores emphasized the importance of cautious planning. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t just leave my job and hope for the best. I had to be prepared and ensure I had a safety net for my family,&#8221; she said, highlighting the balance she had to maintain between personal ambition and family responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the interview, Amores emphasized the importance of continuous learning and seeking mentorship. Her approach to trading is methodical, focusing on building a strong foundation before scaling up. She highlighted the critical role of risk management, saying, &#8220;Risk management only works if you&#8217;re following it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She stressed the importance of learning from verified sources. &#8220;The main thing I always say is to try to learn from a vetted person,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This means having some proof that they are who they say they are. It saves you time and headaches. You don&#8217;t want to attempt a master strategy, only to find that they&#8217;re teaching beginner-level material when you&#8217;re at an intermediate or advanced level.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amore&#8217;s journey is marked by her transition from trading small, personal accounts to managing large funds. This progression included experiences with percentage allocation management module (PAMM) accounts for forex and proprietary trading. Reflecting on her experiences, Amores said, &#8220;The thing about trading other people&#8217;s money taught me accountability.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking played a significant role in Amores\'s career. She acknowledged the power of building connections and being open to new opportunities. &#8220;You never know who you&#8217;re talking to,&#8221; she said, underscoring the potential of networking to open doors to larger trading opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores\'s trading strategy centers around liquidity, volume and high-probability setups. She approaches the market with a keen eye for where liquidity is and how it&#8217;s redistributed. &#8220;I&#8217;m always trading in line with liquidity,&#8221; she said, illustrating her tactical approach to trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The psychological aspects of trading are not lost on Amores. She discussed the importance of mindset, visualization and handling the pressures associated with trading large sums of money. Amores has learned to manage these challenges gracefully, contributing to her overall success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amores has set ambitious goals for herself, including trading multimillion-dollar accounts and eventually reaching billion-dollar allocations. Her story is not just about financial success; it&#8217;s about overcoming challenges and pursuing one&#8217;s goals, making her an inspiration to aspiring traders worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/surgetrader">An award-winning prop trading firm offers up to $1 million in funding</a> with just two simple rules.

This decision could set the stage for a Supreme Court clash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a subordinate court ruling limiting Trump&#8217;s speech relating to the case. This directive, fine-tuned by the appellate court, restricts Trump from making statements intended to interfere with the case, <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4424225-trump-jan-6-case-gag-order-appeals-court-declines-review/">reported</a> The Hill on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the D.C. Circuit decided against rehearing the case, it is likely that the Supreme Court may be petitioned to review the gag order. Trump can request the justices to suspend it while under review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of many legal fights Trump is currently embroiled in. The Supreme Court has already consented to hear an appeal of a ruling that removed Trump from Colorado\'s ballot due to the 14th Amendment&#8217;s insurrection prohibition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should the justices review Trump&#8217;s gag order, it would be their introductory intervention in any of Trump\'s four criminal cases since his indictment. In D.C., special counsel <strong>Jack Smith</strong> accused Trump of committing four felonies, including conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump has entered a not guilty plea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court may soon be dealing with another legal struggle in this case: whether Trump has criminal immunity for his official acts during his presidency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The circuit court panel disagreed with Judge <strong>Tanya Chutkan\'s</strong> use of the term &#8220;target,&#8221; fearing it could restrict Trump from responding to potential witnesses and critics. The court also removed Smith from the list of protected persons under Chutkan\'s order, allowing Trump to make more direct statements about the case&#8217;s principal prosecutor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, most of the 68-page ruling supports Chutkan\'s rationale for imposing a gag order, asserting that Trump\'s speech could disrupt the case, discourage witness participation, and incite threats and intimidation for those involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36710420/paul-krugman-blames-ron-desantiss-anti-vax-crusade-for-thousands-of-deaths-musk-reacts-you-give-econ?itm_source=parsely-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Krugman Blames Ron Desantis&#8217;s Anti-Vax Crusade For Thousands Of Deaths, Musk Reacts: &#8216;You Give Economics A Bad Name&#8217;</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: This is not the first attempt by Trump&#8217;s legal team to <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/12/36406071/jack-smith-moves-to-block-trumps-political-attacks-in-election-subversion-case">combat restrictions</a> on the ex-president&#8217;s comments related to the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Trump <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/23/08/33560873/trump-in-court-again-for-arraignment-on-charges-tied-to-jan-6-riot-efforts-to-overturn-2020-elec">pleaded not guilty</a> to four federal charges related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, vowing to comply with federal law and not discuss the case with potential witnesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gag order, <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/11/35885963/free-speech-or-censorship-court-ponders-over-trumps-election-case-gag-order">initially issued</a> by Judge Chutkan, aimed to prevent Trump from publicly criticizing prosecutors, potential witnesses, or court staff involved in the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo via Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read Next: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36705592/ukraines-zelenskyy-invites-trump-to-kyiv-amid-war-with-russia-if-you-can-stop-the-war?itm_source=parsely-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ukraine&#8217;s Zelenskyy Invites Trump To Kyiv Amid War With Russia: &#8216;If You Can Stop The War&#8217;</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style="font-family: \'Lato\', sans-serif">\n    <div>\n        <hr style="border: 0;height: 5px;background: #225aa9">\n        <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5;background-position: center;background-size: cover;justify-content: center"></div>\n        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;padding-top: 20px">\n            Engineered by <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: none;color: #225aa9;font-size: 1rem">Benzinga Neuro</span>, Edited by <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: none;color: #225aa9;font-size: 1rem">\n                <u><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/author/shivdeep-dhaliwal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #225aa9;text-decoration: none">Shivdeep Dhaliwal</a></u>\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <hr style="border: 0;height: 1px;background: #225aa9">\n        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;padding-top: 20px">\n            The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.\n            <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #225aa9;text-decoration: none">Learn more.</a>\n        </p>\n        <hr style="border: 0;height: 5px;background: #225aa9">\n    </div>\n</div>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36750283/trumps-gag-order-appeal-denied-supreme-court-might-be-next', 'image': [{'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/Donald-Trump_33.jpeg'}, {'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/Donald-Trump_33.jpeg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/Donald-Trump_33.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'News'}, {'name': 'Politics'}, {'name': 'General'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': '2024 Presidential Election'}, {'name': 'Donald Trump'}, {'name': 'January 6'}, {'name': 'Shivdeep Dhaliwal'}, {'name': 'Trump'}, {'name': 'Trump election case'}, {'name': 'Trump Election Interference'}]}

However, a majority showed contentment with the possibility of Trump securing the Republican nomination once again, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/exit-poll-new-hampshire-primary/index.html">reported</a> CNN on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump and former South Carolina Gov. <strong>Nikki Haley</strong> supporters displayed significant differences in their motivations for endorsing their chosen candidates. An estimated 75% of Trump voters expressed strong support for him, with few having reservations or voting primarily to oppose his competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, 40% of Haley voters showed their support due to their dislike for her opponents. Around 30% admitted to having reservations about her, while only a third strongly favored her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Trump and Haley supporters would be displeased if the Republican Party nominated their preferred candidate&#8217;s rival. Three-quarters of Trump voters would be unhappy if Haley won, while 90% of Haley supporters would be dissatisfied if Trump secured his third nomination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exit poll results also illuminated the ideological inclinations of the primary voters, with nearly two-thirds identifying as conservatives. A majority did not align with the MAGA movement, and about half believed President <strong>Joe Biden&#8217;s</strong> 2020 victory was legitimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like in Iowa, immigration and the economy were the top issues for New Hampshire&#8217;s Republican primary voters. Most described the economy&#8217;s state as poor or not so good, and about half favored deporting most undocumented immigrants. Unlike in Iowa, a majority opposed a federal ban on most or all abortions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36712538/setback-for-russia-analyst-says-kim-jong-uns-ballistic-missiles-can-be-easily-detected-with-patriot?itm_source=parsely-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Jong Un&#8217;s Ballistic Missiles Can Be Detected With Patriot Defense System: Analyst</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Exit polls offer insights into primary voters&#8217; demographics and political views, but as estimates, they lack precision, especially in preliminary numbers yet to be weighted against final results, providing a glimpse into the participating voter profiles, noted CNN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36709050/trump-vs-haley-new-poll-shows-undeclared-voters-gravitate-toward-this-republican-candidate-in-new-ha">poll conducted by Suffolk University</a> prior to the primary, Trump had the backing of 55% of respondents, showing a 5% increase from an earlier poll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, a CNN/University of New Hampshire (UNH) poll <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36710231/ron-desantis-exit-from-presidential-race-likely-to-give-a-boost-to-trump-shows-latest-poll">suggested</a> that 62% of the voters who initially supported DeSantis would now back Trump, giving a potential boost to Trump&#8217;s campaign.

Raw Data: {'id': 36748357, 'author': 'Maureen Meehan', 'created': 'Tue, 23 Jan 2024 18:12:20 -0400', 'updated': 'Tue, 23 Jan 2024 18:12:21 -0400', 'title': 'Cannabis Use Does Not Impede Opioid Addiction Recovery, According To Major Study', 'teaser': 'Cannabis use should not be a barrier to receiving life-saving medications for opioid use disorder, says Yale researcher.', 'body': '<p>For many people struggling with opioid use disorder (OUD), accessing life-saving medications like methadone and buprenorphine (MOUD) has been hampered by a surprising hurdle: the requirement to <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/opioids">abstain from cannabis</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new study published in the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00952990.2023.2287406">American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse</a> challenges this policy, finding no significant link between cannabis use and relapse on non-medical opioids among patients receiving MOUD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Cannabis use should not be a barrier to receiving life-saving medications for opioid use disorder,&#8221; said lead investigator <strong>Dr. Joao P. De Aquino</strong> of Yale University. &#8220;Policies demanding abstinence from cannabinoids as a prerequisite for MOUD should be reconsidered.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The research sheds light on a murky area in addiction treatment. Prior studies offered conflicting evidence, with some suggesting cannabis could worsen OUD outcomes while <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/08/33606242/cannabis-can-help-reduce-unregulated-opioid-use-and-manage-cravings-study-finds">others hinted</a> at potential benefits. Interested in clarifying this relationship, the research team conducted a meta-analysis of 10 longitudinal studies encompassing over 8,300 individuals with OUD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Outcome: </strong>The results were clear: cannabis use, regardless of the amount or frequency, did not statistically affect the risk of returning to non-medical opioids among participants receiving MOUD. This held true even when examining individual medications like methadone and buprenorphine separately, noted the authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These findings neither confirm concerns about cannabis increasing nonmedical opioid use during MOUD nor do they endorse its efficacy in decreasing nonmedical opioid use with MOUD,&#8221; the researchers acknowledged while stressing the need for individualized OUD treatment plans that go beyond blanket cannabis restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Effective treatment should involve evaluating patients for cannabis use disorder, providing comprehensive pain management, and addressing co-occurring mental health conditions,&#8221; Dr. De Aquino explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commenting on the study, <strong>Dr. Scott Hadland</strong> of Mass General for Children stressed the importance of patient-centered treatment. &#8220;We should work with patients to determine whether they&#8217;re interested in and able to cut back on their cannabis use alongside their opioid use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ultimately, we want to meet them where they are and support any positive changes they&#8217;re seeking to make.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The study does not advocate for cannabis as a treatment for OUD. However, it does challenge the notion that it hinders recovery. This paves the way for more flexible and individualized treatment approaches for people battling opioid addiction, potentially saving lives and reducing unnecessary barriers to much-needed medications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Opioid-Related&nbsp;Drug Overdoses Continue To&nbsp;Rise</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, more than&nbsp;107,000 Americans died from a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/12/30022658/this-new-fentanyl-overdose-reversal-drug-is-stronger-than-narcan-heres-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drug overdose in 2021</a>&nbsp;mainly due to fentanyl, which is being&nbsp;produced and smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico primarily by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/01/30298349/el-chapos-son-capo-of-mexicos-biggest-drug-cartel-captured-revenge-and-violence-spreading-in-sin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sinaloa Cartel</a>, say US authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image created using artificial intelligence tools</em></p>', 'url': 'https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36748357/cannabis-use-does-not-impede-opioid-addiction-recovery-according-to-major-study', 'image': [{'size': 'small', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/Cannabis-and-Opioid-addiction.jpeg'}, {'size': 'large', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/Cannabis-and-Opioid-addiction.jpeg'}, {'size': 'thumb', 'url': 'https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/Cannabis-and-Opioid-addiction.jpeg'}], 'channels': [{'name': 'Cannabis'}, {'name': 'News'}, {'name': 'Top Stories'}], 'stocks': [], 'tags': [{'name': 'American Journal of Drug And Alcohol Abuse'}, {'name': 'Dr. Joao P.
